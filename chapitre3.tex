\section{Identifying disturbance models}

t.b.d. —depends if we identify useful methods.

\begin{outline}
	\1 Test methods of identifying the disturbance model parameters from simulated measurements.
	\2 Using data from linear system from section 2.1.
	\2 Using data from grinding model simulations from section 2.3.
	\1 Results of identifying the random shock distribution with noise using Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to fit Gaussian Mixture models.
	\1 Problem of inference of the RODD - simply inverting model magnifies noise.
	\1 Eriksson and Isaksson's approach to system detection. Using an observer to identify system from a set of known systems.
	\1 Other method: Variational inference? (how is this different from EM?)
	\1 Sequential inference techniques? E.g. Sequential Monte Carlo. Don't know enough about this. Mention in conclusion and recommendations for future work.

\section{Evaluation with real industrial data (t.b.d)}

t.b.d. —depends if the data is good enough for the purpose.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Description of plant and data acquisition process.
	\item Preparation and pre-processing of data—outliers, missing values, standardization parameters.
	\item Ideally: Demonstrate disturbance characterisation (model structure), identification (parameters) with one or more method and discuss results. 
\end{itemize}
