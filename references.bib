	abstract = {This paper deals with the state estimation for the systems under measurement noise whose mean and covariance change with Markov transition probabilities. The minimum variance estimate for the state involves consideration of a prohibitively large number of sequences, so that the usual computation method becomes impractical. In the algorithm proposed here, the estimate is calculated with a relatively small number of sequences sampled at random from the set of a large number of sequences. The average risk of the algorithm is shown to converge to the optimal average risk as the number of sampled sequences increases. An ideal sampling probability yielding a very fast convergence is found. The probability is approximated in a minimum mean squared sense by a probability according to which sequences can be sampled sequentially and with great ease. This policy of determination of sampling probability makes it possible to design practical and efficient algorithms. Digital simulation results show a good performance of the proposed algorithm.},

	"In system identification temporal information is often used only to construct the input samples (or regressors) and outputs, but then it is neglected. For example, in estimating autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX), the regressor is a finite collection of current and past signal observations, but the order of the regressor/output pairs is irrelevant when least squares are used" (Bemporad et al 2018:11)
	"On the other hand, there are many applications in which relevant information is contained not only in data values but also in their temporal order" (Bemporad et al 2018:11)
	"if the time each data-point was collected is taken into account, one can detect changes in the type of regime the data were produced" (Bemporad et al 2018:11)
	"All these examples are characterized by the need of fitting multiple models and understanding when switches from one model to another occur" (Bemporad et al 2018:11)

(Bemporad et al 2018:20)
	"A main strength of the approach is its versatility in describing a large class of parametric models, as the shape of the model and the way it jumps depends on the shape of the loss functions used for fitting the model parameters and for inference" (Bemporad et al 2018:20)

	abstract = {This paper deals with the recursive calculation of the conditional mean estimator for the state of linear discrete time systems driven by non-Gaussian noise. It is motivated by the fact that difficulties with the Kalman estimator are often not the result of system nonlinearities (which are dealt with adequately by the linearizing techniques of Mowery and Cox), but of non-Gaussian drivers. The approach taken is to approximate the driving noise density by a sum of Gaussian terms. An exact recursive expression for the conditional mean is then developed. The expression involves terms (nonlinear in the observations) whose number grows exponentially with the length of the observed sequence. Several approximations to the conditional mean estimate, which require constant (rather than increasing) computational and storage load, are suggested. These approximations, two of which rely on concepts from the field of Hypothesis Testing, may be considered adaptive filters. An example of the application of these approximation is given. In all cases, retention of a sufficient number of terms in the approximation results in mean square errors smaller than those of the optimum linear estimator. When the energy of the driving noise is large in comparison to that of the observation noise, and when the driving noise density is poorly described by a Gaussian function, the difference between the mean squared error performance of these estimates and the optimal linear estimate can be considerable.},

These difﬁculties are well recognised in the literature, resulting (for example) in extensive study of subspace-based techniques, as well as recent interest in ‘data driven’ local co-ordinate approaches to gradient search solutions. The paper here proposes a different strategy that employs the expectation–maximisation (EM) technique. The consequence is an algorithm that is iterative, with associated likelihood values that are locally convergent to stationary points of the (Gaussian) likelihood function. Furthermore, theoretical and empirical evidence presented here establishes additional attractive properties such as numerical robustness, avoidance of difﬁcult parametrization choices, the ability to naturally and easily estimate non-zero initial conditions, and moderate computational cost. Moreover, since the methods here are maximum-likelihood based, they have associated known and asymptotically optimal statistical properties.},

A discussion as to how these problems can be solved step by step in principle and practice from this approach is presented. As a specific example, the closed form Wiener-Kalman solution for linear estimation in Gaussian noise is derived. The purpose of the paper is to show that the Bayesian approach provides; 1) a general unifying framework within which to pursue further researches in stochastic estimation and control problems, and 2) the necessary computations and difficulties that must be overcome for these problems.

	"Optimal control theory has had very limited application in mineral processing practice. The reason for this has been the lack of accurate on-line models, the complicated nature of the mathematics and a lack of inexpensive computing power" (Herbst et al 1988:275)
	"This is true because of the highly variable nature of feed materials, frequent mechanical disturbances in a plant and the presence of strongly interacting variables which can and often are manipulated simultaneously in any given control strategy" (Herbst et al 1988:275)
	"These problems do in fact provide the basis for rich opportunities through dynamic optimization" (Herbst et al 1988:275)
	"In the past, optimization of a process was usually associated with finding the optimum steady state inputs and automatic control was usually associated with the stabilization of the process and the two areas (optimization and automatic control) were not connected" (Herbst et al 1988:275)
	"it is possible to dynamically optimize a process with a control strategy in order to adapt to changes in feed materia or operating condition" (Herbst et al 1988:275)
	"optimal control is an attractive investment even though its implementation is somewhat difficult due to its rigorous mathematical nature and large computational requirement" (Herbst et al 1988:276)
	"the steps involved in developing optimal control strategies for crushers, SAG circuits and ball mill circuits and the improvements resulting from their implementation" (Herbst et al 1988:276)
	"a conventional controller is unable to efficiently take into account of the strong effects that a single manipulated variable may have on two or more of the controlled variables" (Herbst et al 1988:276)
	"the optimum gain constants for proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers depend upon the character of the ore and operating condition" (Herbst et al 1988:276)
	"PID controllers in a grinding circuit can be tuned for very fast response when the ore is soft but when the ore is hard the controller gains will have to be reduced since the reaction of the grinding circuit to control actions is increased and the possibility of overload is greater" (Herbst et al 1988:276)
	"Optimal control, in contrast, incorporates mathematical models into the control strategy so that information about interactions, process parameter variations and other disturbances is available in order to provide the best possible control performance" (Herbst et al 1988:276)
	"an example of the application of optimal control to an industrial rod/ball mill circuit is presented" (Herbst et al 1988:276)
	"the optimal values of ore feed rate and sump water were calculated every 20 s from an optimal feedback control law" (Herbst et al 1988:276)
	"A Kalman filter was used to provide the optimizer with estimates of mass holdups, particle size, mass flow rates, ore hardness and other unmeasured variables that the optimize used" (Herbst et al 1988:276)
	"a dynamic model of the circuit with differential equations describing the dynamics of two-size fractions in the rod mill, sump and ball mills" (Herbst et al 1988:277)
	"The crusher model consists of 15 differential equations describing the breakage and transport characteristics within the crusher. The equations allow for the possibility of two individual ore types in the circuit" (Herbst et al 1988:277)
	"For SAG milling a simplified phenomenological model consisting of three differential equations describing rock, water and ball hold-up in the mill was used" (Herbst et al 1988:277)
	"The practical implementation of an optimal control strategy can be a formidable task that requires three major steps" (Herbst et al 1988:277)
	"(1) the development of an on-line model of the comminution circuit; (2) the development of algorithms for optimal estimation and control of the process (state) variables; and (3) the development of interfaces between the operator and the strategy, the engineer and the strategy and the strategy and the control hardware" (Herbst et al 1988:277)
	"An integrated software package that allows a plant engineer without intensive training in optimal control to set-up and implement such a strategy must include software for: (1) mathematical models for process units and plants (2) plant state estimation techniques; (3) optimal control algorithms and controllers; (4) real-time control system interface; and (5) interactive tuning and testing of control strategies" (Herbst et al 1988:277)

	"it is often too costly or difficult to measure without error all the variables" (Herbst et al 1988:280)
	"modeling errors are introduced since the real process is subject to unknown random disturbance" (Herbst et al 1988:280)
	"This controller is also known as a linear quadratic gaussian (LQG) controller since it minimizes a quadratic performance index for a stochastic linear system with gaussian statistics" (Herbst et al 1988:280)
	"The Kalman filter estimator is a powerful means to obtain an on-line estimate" (Herbst et al 1988:280)
	"The Kalman filter does this by optimally combining model predictions and measurements to yield an improved estimate" (Herbst et al 1988:280)

"The design of optimal controllers for processes subject to stochastic disturbances has received considerable attention in the literature (Box and Jenkins 1970, Astrom 1970" (MacGregor et al 1984:390)
"The controllers are derived under the assumption that the stochastic disturbances are the major disturbances in the system" (MacGregor et al 1984:390)
"Although most processes have some stochastic disturbances, in many cases they are not the major disturbances in the system" (MacGregor et al 1984:390)
"The major upsets in the process are often due to deterministic disturbances such as sudden step changes, ramps, or exponential changes to new levels," (MacGregor et al 1984:390)
"These may occur randomly in time due to sudden unexpected loads on the system or due to unanticipated set-point changes made by operators on some control loops in the system" (MacGregor et al 1984:390)
"As with any optimal control problem, in order to solve it, we need to have a model not only for the process dynamics but also for the disturbances for which we desire to compensate" (MacGregor et al 1984:390)
"It is shown here that sampled deterministic disturbances occurring infrequently, but at random times, can be represented by the same structural form of model as the ARIMA stochastic models-the only difference being in the probability distribution assumed for the random shocks (a,) that drive the models" (MacGregor et al 1984:390)
"the linear quadratic optimal-control laws for processes subject either to ARIMA stochastic disturbances or to randomly occurring deterministic disturbances are shown to be identical for models of the equivalent structure" (MacGregor et al 1984:390)
"These results enable us to assess how well a controller designed to handle a disturbance from one class of disturbances (e.g., stochastic) will perform in the presence of a particular disturbance from the other class (e.g., deterministic" (MacGregor et al 1984:390)
"We start by considering models for some of the simpler, more common disturbances such as steps, ramps, and exponential rises to new levels, and then we generalize the model to include almost any structure" (MacGregor et al 1984:391)
"Step Disturbances" (MacGregor et al 1984:391)
"Probability Density Function" (MacGregor et al 1984:391)
"Most of the probability density is located at zero (99\% of it if one expects, on the average, only one step every 100 sampling intervals), and the remainder is distributed perhaps as a normal distribution centered on zero" (MacGregor et al 1984:391)
"Ramp Disturbances" (MacGregor et al 1984:391)
"General Model for Randomly Occurring Deterministic Disturbances" (MacGregor et al 1984:392)
"state-variable form of representation" (MacGregor et al 1984:392)
"capable of modeling most randomly occurring deterministic disturbances that might be encountered in practice" (MacGregor et al 1984:393)
"deterministic disturbances that occur at random times can be modeled by the general difference equation models" (MacGregor et al 1984:393)
"These have the same structure as the general ARIMA and state-space models that have been commonly used to model stochastic disturbances" (MacGregor et al 1984:393)
"The only difference lies in the distribution of the shocks" (MacGregor et al 1984:393)
"we will be concerned with representing the disturbance as it appears in the output" (MacGregor et al 1984:393)
"3.1 Minimum Mean Squared Error Control" (MacGregor et al 1984:393)
"Since the complementary function (f2(B)at) is identical for ARIMA stochastic disturbances (N,) and for randomly occurring deterministic disturbances (D,) of the same structure, then, obviously, the linear MMSE controller will be identical for these dual disturbance processes" (MacGregor et al 1984:394)
"As an example, the MMSE controllers for a stochastic random-walk disturbance and for a randomly occurring step disturbance are identical" (MacGregor et al 1984:394)
"For such deterministic disturbances, minimum-variance control is equivalent to what is called minimal-prototype or deadbeat control" (MacGregor et al 1984:394)
"often the stochastic models obtained from the process identification study over a short time period represent only minor disturbances or noise in the output, and the major disturbances for which control is necessary are deterministic in nature" (MacGregor et al 1984:394)
"In this case one would logically discard the ARIMA stochastic model and design the controller using the model appropriate for the particular randomly occurring deterministic process" (MacGregor et al 1984:394)
"As in the case of stochastic disturbances, MMSE control for deterministic disturbances can call for very large variations in the manipulated variable" (MacGregor et al 1984:394)
"Therefore, we may want to design a controller subject to a constraint on the sum of squares of the control settings" (MacGregor et al 1984:394)
"By using discrete transfer-function models together with the deterministic disturbance models (2.13), it can be shown that the solution to this problem is exactly that obtained by the spectral factorization method (Wilson 1970 and Whittle 1963) for the equivalent ARIMA stochastic disturbance model" (MacGregor et al 1984:394)
"If the elements of at, have distributions as illustrated in Figure 1, then the controller minimizing (3.7) or (3.8) would be nonlinear, and its solution is intractable for all but the most trivial cases" (MacGregor et al 1984:395)
"To develop these control schemes one must be able to build models for the process and for the disturbances" (MacGregor et al 1984:395)
"When only stochastic disturbances are present, the parametric time-series methods (Box and Jenkins 1970 and Astrom 1970) for building joint dynamic-stochastic models have proven to be very useful" (MacGregor et al 1984:395)
"When the system is relatively free of stochastic disturbances, the identification of a transfer-function model for the process is readily accomplished by using one of the traditional non-parametric identification methods, such as direct step testing (Rake 1980), Fourier analysis (Rake 1980), correlation methods (Box and Jenkins 1970), or spectral analysis (Jenkins and Watts 1968)" (MacGregor et al 1984:395)
"Models that are capable of characterizing the randomly occurring deterministic disturbances in the output can then be obtained by one's direct knowledge of the nature and source of these disturbances (e.g., step changes are to be made in set points, or occasional step changes in an input variable lead to exponential type behavior in the output)" (MacGregor et al 1984:395)
"Alternatively, since the process is relatively free of stochastic disturbances, the nature of these deterministic disturbances can be observed directly in the output records" (MacGregor et al 1984:395)
"since the models for these two types of disturbances can be represented by the same type of ARIMA difference equation structure, then their sum should be approximated by a model of this structure as well" (MacGregor et al 1984:397)
"Time series identification methods (Box and Jenkins 1970) could, therefore, be used on data containing a mixture of both types of disturbances to identify an approximate ARIMA model for their combined effect on the output" (MacGregor et al 1984:397)
"no real distinction should be made between optimal stochastic control and optimal control for deterministic disturbances that may occur randomly in time" (MacGregor et al 1984:398)},

	abstract = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithms typically use a constant output bias for feedback, which can be interpreted as assuming that a constant disturbance perturbs the process output. This assumption leads to sluggish rejection of most real unmeasured disturbances since these disturbances generally enter the loop through state or input channels. Improved performance is often possible by designing an unmeasured disturbance model that explicitly incorporates input and state disturbance effects. A Kalman filter can then be employed to estimate the disturbances, allowing the control algorithm to reject them more quickly. This paper presents design guidelines for a disturbance model that accommodates unmeasured disturbances entering through the process input, state, or output. Conditions that guarantee detectability of the augmented system model are provided. A simulation example illustrates the performance benefits possible through this approach.},

	"Abstract Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithms typically use a constant output bias for feedback, which can be interpreted as assuming that a constant disturbance perturbs the process output" (Badgwell and Muske 2002:1621)
	"This assumption leads to sluggish rejection of most real unmeasured disturbances since these disturbances generally enter the loop through state or input channels" (Badgwell and Muske 2002:1621)
	"Improved performance is often possible by designing an unmeasured disturbance model that explicitly incorporates input and state disturbance effects" (Badgwell and Muske 2002:1621)
	"A Kalman filter can then be employed to estimate the disturbances, allowing the control algorithm to reject them more quickly" (Badgwell and Muske 2002:1621)
	"This paper presents design guidelines for a disturbance model that accommodates unmeasured disturbances entering through the process input, state, or output" (Badgwell and Muske 2002:1621)
	"A second general approach to eliminating steadystate offset involves augmenting a process model with an assumed unmeasured disturbance model. The disturbance is generally assumed to remain constant in the future and its effect on the controlled variables is removed by shifting the steadystate target for the controller" (Badgwell and Muske 2002:1621)
	"The constant state disturbance model is a standard technique in linear quadratic regulator design" (Badgwell and Muske 2002:1621)
	"The main contribution of this paper is a set of disturbance model design guidelines for linear MPC that lead to offset-free control" (Badgwell and Muske 2002:1622)
	"Closed-loop controller performance is directly related to how accurately the disturbance model represents the actual disturbances entering a process" (Badgwell and Muske 2002:1622)

	"the increasing share of wind generation in the power system energy mix can bring unwanted consequences, mainly due to the stochastic nature of wind power" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:234)
	"In order to study the impact of wind generation to the power system, time series of the power output of the wind plants are used, usually obtained by a procedure consisting of two distinct steps: the utilization of data and information on the stochastic prime mover (wind activity) and the subsequent transformation of the wind activity to power output" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:234)
	"In order to capture the wind stochasticity, recordings for a sufficiently long period should be used. However, because the data records typically are of short length, it can become necessary to use stochastic simulation techniques for the derivation of synthetic time series for the modeling of the wind activity" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:234)
	"even one year of measured high-quality data can be entirely insufficient to estimate the statistical properties of the stored energy content" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:234)
	"even 20 years of data are insufficient to obtain accurate estimates of loss of load probability" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:234)
	"The necessity to at least have at hand a suitable method to simulate stochastic power time series from measured data becomes more urgent as systems to be designed based on stochastic sources become more complex, more densely meshed with a higher penetration of inert distributed resources to support the stochastic generation facilities such as storage, demand side management facilities, or backup generation" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:234)
	"the wind speed is typically the basis for the investigation" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:234)
	"Due to the complexity in deriving the detailed power curve, in most cases, a less accurate wind speed/wind power curve is used as the input-output characteristic" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:234)

	"the definition of a relatively small number of parameters, the AR and ARMA models allow for controlled synthetization of a desired acf" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:236)
	"however, does not hold for the pdf; in general, the pdf of the generated time series does not match the one of the measured data.

	abstract = {Jump Box–Jenkins (BJ) models are a collection of a finite set of linear dynamical submodels in BJ form that switch over time, according to a Markov chain. This paper addresses the problem of maximuma-posteriori estimation of jump BJ models from a given training input/output dataset. The proposed solution method estimates the coefficients of the BJ submodels, the state transition probabilities of the Markov chain regulating the switching of operating modes, and the corresponding mode sequence hidden in the dataset. In particular, the posterior distribution of all the unknown variables characterizing the jump BJ model is derived and then maximized using a coordinate ascent algorithm. The resulting estimation algorithm alternates between Gauss–Newton optimization of the coefficients of the BJ submodels, a method derived based on an instance of prediction error methods tailored to BJ models with switching coefficients, and approximated dynamic programming for optimization of the sequence of active modes. The quality of the proposed estimation approach is evaluated on a numerical example based on synthetic data and in a case study related to segmentation of honeybee dances.},

(Powell and Mainza 2006:1489)"Almost all of a ball mills power draw is determined by the ball loading, with variation in the ore loading contributing only a few percent" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1489)"For general pilot work, as opposed to a specially calibrated and usually cantilevered mill with a high level of accuracy in torque measurement (Pietsch, 1972), the variation in power draw with ore loading in the mill is lost in the noise of the power measurement" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1489)"Austin et al. (1984) showed that both underloading and overloading of ore in the ball mills lead to low breakage rates which result in lower grinding efficiencies" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1489)"For an overflow ball mill the slurry level is consistent, but the solids loading in the slurry can vary widely" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1489)"when different milling conditions, such as ball size, mill filling, grinding media shape, discharge mechanism, slurry density, etc. are tested at a constant mill feedrate, the differences in mill performance can be almost completely absorbed by changes in mill voidage, when some of the conditions lead to under-filling of the mill" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1489)"it was found that there does not appear to be a reliable standard pilot milling technique that would address these issues." (Powell and Mainza 2006:1489)"To the surprise of the investigators it was found that the chosen feedrate was at the tail end of the mill performance" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1490)"At lower feedrates the scats have a considerably coarser grind which drops off and flattens right up to 850 kg/h, before dropping to its lowest value" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1490)"By chance the pilot trials had been conducted at the throughput where the two trends crossed over" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1490)"What is more, it can be deduced that the optimal operating point of the pilot mill is at 600 kg/h, just prior to the dropoff in fineness of grind" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1490)"a decision has to be made on what conditions to conduct trials at when investigating the performance of a SAG mill for the first time" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"Generally the input of the operator, plant records, and some short term step tests to check the response of the mill can be used to help determine the most favourable test conditions" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"Often the standard operating conditions are opted for by default. This strategy can be useful for setting up a base case model of the mill, but when testing the influence of changing some particular variable, for example feed type or size distribution, the results can be as misleading as the example of inappropriate ball mill pilot tests" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"It can also be the case that mill operators run a mill at a particular filling, speed, percent solids, etc. more by default than design" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"Many a site has hung tenaciously onto an historically established good operating regime, despite major changes to ore, liner design, ball load etc., resulting in the mill operating well off its peak performance potential." (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"This is often an issue to be addressed in consulting optimisation work." (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"For a SAG mill there are many variables against which a grindcurve can be developed. The ones that can be most readily varied, and are common control parameters, are mill speed, mill filling, and percent solids" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"As the ideal percent solids can generally be established up front (as described earlier), and many mills have a fixed speed, the mill filling is the most common parameter to vary in developing a grindcurve" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"A critical part of developing a filling grindcurve is establishing the relationship between percent filling of the mill and an external load measurement, such as load cells, bearing back pressure, or power when the other two are lacking" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"It is essential that the filling is accurately known, and this can only be assessed through entering the mill to physically measure the filling" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"The authors record for a standard four point measurement (to provide a reliable average along the mill) from mill stop to restart is 12 min, including lockout and safe entry procedures" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"A key to this is using a laser tape measure, a rugged Hilti surveyors unit, accurate to 1 mm and with a 100 m range is used by the authors. This enables accurate and rapid height and diameter measurements in any size mill" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"A critical parameter in the load filling relationship, and in modelling a mills performance, is the ball load, and this should be established through grindout" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"The filling data at the end of the grindout provides an excellent extreme point in the filling-load curve, and helps to give an accurate curve fit" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"For a grindcurve covering 5-6 conditions, 2 crash stops and the grindout to measure ball filling are sufficient to establish the filling calibration" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"Convenient tests during the snapshot are chosen for the crash stop calibrations. For the remainder of the snapshot tests the filling is calculated from the calibration curve. Accuracies of 0.3\% filling can be attained." (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"It has been found that the gradual adjustment of feedrate in small steps is the most rapid path to a new filling and feedrate" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1492)"An example of an excellent grindcurve that was established as part of the P9N AMIRA test work conducted at the AngloGold Ashanti Kopanang site," (Powell and Mainza 2006:1492)"The grindcurves show how the power, throughput, and circuit product vary with mill filling." (Powell and Mainza 2006:1492)"The resultant grindcurves were used to establish the ideal conditions for the research test work. In addition the grindcurve is a production tool, which can be used to select the optimal target operating conditions" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1492)"It is also operationally more stable to remain T ( o \% M" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1492)"below the power peak, rather than seeking back and forth over the peak and drifting into periods of poor operation. A combination of power seeking and the desired mill load can be used to control the mill." (Powell and Mainza 2006:1493)"A grindcurve for a high aspect open circuit first stage SAG mill is shown in Fig. 8. It is apparent that this is dramatically different to that for the low aspect fine grinding Kopanang mill." (Powell and Mainza 2006:1493)"The throughput and power peaks are far apart, at 22\% and 35\%. The finest grind does however still seem to lie just before the power peak" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1493)"Naturally for this open circuit mill followed by a ball mill the objective of the mill operation is quite different to the closed circuit single stage Kopanang mill." (Powell and Mainza 2006:1493)"The new concept that was so successfully trialled on this pilot test campaign was to develop a grinding curve for the mill under each new test condition." (Powell and Mainza 2006:1493)"The grinding curve is the product size as a function of feedrate, for a fixed feed size" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1493)"Once the peak was established then more comprehensive sampling could take place at the appropriate throughput." (Powell and Mainza 2006:1493)"By developing the full grinding curve for each test condition the conclusions where dramatically changed from those drawn at any given throughput" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1493)"In fact it was found that the conclusions are a function of the arbitrarily chosen mill throughput" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1493)"It has therefore been concluded that no ball mill test work should be conducted without developing and comparing the grind curves over the full reasonable operating range of the mill." (Powell and Mainza 2006:1493)"The data presented for the SAG mills once again reinforces the fact that the throughput and power peaks lie at different mill fillings." (Powell and Mainza 2006:1493)"The resultant curves are also of direct use in establishing optimal control objectives of the mills, in seeking the balance between throughput and product size, or just seeking maximum throughput" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1493)"With periodic tests used to establish the grindcurves as the ore type changes, and for variations in major operating parameters such as ball filling, a family of grindcurves can be established to provide outstanding control objectives, and checks on the circuit performance." (Powell and Mainza 2006:1493)"Single-point sizing This gives the percent retained on a single screen size by using only a Marcy cup and scale or a measuring cylinder and balance, and the chosen screen" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1493)"This takes only a few minutes, yet it has been found that when properly applied the results are within 1\% of the fully screened sample. This technique is excellent for quick feedback when trying to stabilise a pilot or production circuit, or check the stability of a grinding circuit, or quickly developing a grindcurve" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1493)},

	abstract = {The term randomly occurring deterministic disturbances refers to a class of process disturbances that occur randomly and infrequently in time and have a known effect on the behavior of the process. Since these disturbances occur infrequently in time, traditional filtering methods (e.g., Kalman filter, EKF) which assume identically distributed noise terms may not yield acceptable performance. The reason for this is that, when tuning the filter, a compromise must be made between sensitivity to noise and the ability to track these disturbances when they do occur. The stochastic model of these disturbances leads to a multi-filter approach for the state estimation. Since the number of filters grows exponentially with the data length, a suboptimal algorithm is required. The performance of this approach is evaluated for state/parameter estimation of a continuous polymerization reactor.},

	"This work proposes a framework for modeling disturbances that exhibit time-varying characteristics typically witnessed in process industries" (Wong and Lee 2007:233)
	"Through examples, it is shown that the use of existing linear, stationary models is limiting" (Wong and Lee 2007:233)
	"critical to the successful implementation of Model Predictive Control (MPC), the de facto standard for industrial advanced process control, is the availability of an appropriate description of plant behavior" (Wong and Lee 2007:233)
	"disturbance modeling is crucial for it accounts for the eÆect of unmeasured signals, unmodeled plant dynamics as well as unexplainable phenomena (the residuals)" (Wong and Lee 2007:233)
	"discrete 2 time linear models with additive disturbances" (Wong and Lee 2007:233)
	"Such behavior includes intermittent drifts, abrupt jumps, and outliers, all commonly witnessed patterns in process industries" (Wong and Lee 2007:233)
	"Modeling and identiØcation of such behavior is the focus of this paper" (Wong and Lee 2007:233)
	"300Øcation in the presence of non-stationary noise is a relatively unexplored Time Unitsommunity" (Wong and Lee 2007:233)
	"This work is a step towards providing a formal framework for more realistic description of hitherto unquantiØable signals" (Wong and Lee 2007:233)
	"In system identiØcation literature, dk is commonly approximated as (stationary) Øltered white noise" (Wong and Lee 2007:234)
	"Eq. (1) is extended to allow for {\textbackslash}random" walk type drifting behavior" (Wong and Lee 2007:234)
	"the classical approach to identiØcation is limiting in the case depicted in Fig. (1). One suboptimal method is to ignore portions of data that exhibit 'non-compliant' behavior" (Wong and Lee 2007:234)
	"the potential use of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in providing a signiØcant generalization of the current model form used for process control, is explored" (Wong and Lee 2007:234)
	"A Ønite-state Markov chain is used for describing disturbance mode transitions" (Wong and Lee 2007:234)
	"The Markov chain re∞ects probabilistic state transitions which depend only on the immediate past." (Wong and Lee 2007:234)
	"The resulting plant is termed a 'Markov Jump Linear System' (MJLS)" (Wong and Lee 2007:234)
	"a restricted MJLS representation is considered for describing a wide class of commonly seen disturbances" (Wong and Lee 2007:234)
	"This HMM approach has hitherto found limited use for disturbance modeling. Robertson and Lee (1998) proposed a special kind of Markovian jump disturbances for the modeling of abrupt changes but there, the focus was on state estimation" (Wong and Lee 2007:234)
	"This contribution is chie∞y to demonstrate the viability of restricted MJLS's as a model structure suitable for a wide spectrum of interesting disturbance signals" (Wong and Lee 2007:234)
	"0 It has been shown (Vidal et al., 2002) that for general MJLS's there exists y an inØnite number of combinations of dis- -300 crete and continuous state cardinalities that will give the same input-output behavior" (Wong and Lee 2007:237)
	"MLE optimization is typically non-convex; the likelihood surface is fraught with multiple optima. As such, the EM algorithm converges to the nearest stationary point" (Wong and Lee 2007:237)
	"It is postulated that more realistic disturbance modeling would result in better identiØcation of plant dynamics" (Wong and Lee 2007:238)
	"It is believed that the proposed approach is a suitable mathematical framework for describing a wide class of disturbance patterns commonly found in process industries" (Wong and Lee 2007:238)
	"the adoption of stationary models oftentimes results in sub-par performance, in terms of estimation and therefore model-based control" (Wong and Lee 2007:238)
	"By restricting the general class of MJLS's, and using prior knowledge where appropriate, it is hoped that a suitable balance between the expressive power of the models and computational tractability, has been achieved" (Wong and Lee 2007:238)},

Existing linear, stationary disturbance models are oftentimes limiting in the face of time-varying characteristics typically witnessed in process industries. These include intermittent drifts, abrupt changes, temporary oscillations, outliers and the likes. This work proposes a Hidden Markov Model-based framework to deal with such situations that exhibit discrete, modal behavior. The usefulness of the proposed disturbance framework – from modeling to ensuring the integral action under a wide variety of scenarios – is demonstrated through several examples.},
