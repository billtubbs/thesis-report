"Detecting the onset of overloading in a semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill is a challenging task for operators to perform due to the complex and nonlinear nature of an overload" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:960)
"overloading often goes unnoticed at its early stages because the subtle changes in the correlations between measurements are difficult for an operator to observe" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:960)
"linear process monitoring techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) provide inconsistent results with overload detection because of the process nonlinearity" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:960)
"Recently, locally linear embedding (LLE) with a linear classifier has been proposed to detect the early onset of an overload in a SAG mill. In this paper, we compare the suitability of LLE to detect the early onset of an overload against kernel PCA and support vector machines" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:960)
"The primary objective for a SAG mill is to maximize the throughput of fresh ore. Fresh feed rate, however, is constrained by the total volume occupied by the charge inside the mill Norma" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:960)
"If the charge volume c Overload exceeds a certain threshold, the mill begins to overload and ent communition) (inefficient communition and grinding efficiency decreases in a positive feedback may damage equipment) mechanism" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:960)
"The physics of an overload are complex" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:960)
"Fig. 1 illustrates the three possible mechanisms of an overload. The first mechanism is the volumetric overload: a volumetric overload occurs when the charge volume is too high and is caused by overfeeding the mill for the particular steel charge volume and dynamic feed characteristics such as the particle size, hardness, and composition" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:960)
"As accumulation occurs, volume occupied by the charge increases such that the total distance ore can fall under gravity, known as cataracting, decreases" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:960)
"Once a SAG mill has begun to overload, ore will rapidly accumulate until the charge level reaches the center of the mill and slurry spills out of the feed and discharge chutes" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:960)
"Additionally, any disturbance that causes the grinding efficiency in the mill to decrease may also lead to volumetric overloading due to the accumulation of charge in the mill" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:960)
"Depending on the charge density, the bearing pressures may not climb high enough to raise an alarm. Therefore, operators find it difficult to detect volumetric overloading early since this type of overloading is a function of the unknown volume rather than the known mass of the charge" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:961)
"One possible solution is to observe the shift in the center of gravity of the mill. Load distribution may be measured using the pressure readings from the bearing pads supporting the mill. However, the distribution of the charge in the mill is often subtle in the early stages of an overload and also unique for each different overload mechanism" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:961)
"Slurry pooling occurs when an excess of slurry accumulates inside the mill and results in the formation of a slurry pool at the toe of the charge where cataracting ore impacts. The pool acts as a strong damper to the charge's impact energy; as a consequence, grinding efficiency is hampered" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:961)
"The slurry physically fills up the interstitial spaces in the solid charge as the material is lifted up with the rotation of the mill. When all the interstitial space is occupied by slurry, a pool forms at the toe of the charge. The resulting reduction in grinding efficiency may lead to the mill overloading if corrective action to the feed is not taken" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:961)
"To detect this mechanism of overloading, operators rely on observing the deterioration of the positive correlation between bearing pressure and motor power" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:961)
"However, mill power does not have a consistently repeatable behaviour during the onset of this phenomenon due to the unique shift in the mill's center of gravity from both slurry pool formation and subsequent charge accumulation. Consequently, the characteristic inverse correlation between power and bearing pressure of an overload only becomes obvious to operators once the mill is severely overloaded from slurry pooling" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:961)
"The third and final overload mechanism is freewheeling. This occurs when charge becomes trapped between the lifter bars due to the combined effects of centripetal force and the viscosity and density of the charge (Dean, 1999). The inertia of the trapped charge combines with the kinetic energy of the mill and effectively reduces the motor load" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:961)
"As a consequence of reduced grinding efficiency from reduced lifting capacity, the charge becomes static and ore accumulates. This eventually leads to volumetric overloading if corrective action is not taken to increase the feed water or decrease the ore feed rate in order to decrease the density and viscosity of the charge" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:961)
"Ko \& Shang (2011) proposed using principal component analysis (PCA) as a linear process monitoring technique to detect the onset of an overload. Due to its limitations as a linear method, their study does not identify which abnormalities are overload events" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:961)
"To overcome the drawbacks of PCA, we compare three nonlinear process monitoring techniques for overload detection in this paper: Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:961)},

	abstract = {Precise control of SAG mill loading and flotation cell level is critical to maximize production and recovery in mineral concentrators. While expert systems are commonly used to optimize these process operations, the underlying regulatory control is often implemented using traditional proportional-integral­ derivative (PID) controllers or rule-based schemes in the expert systems themselves. This paper describes the use of a model-based predictive control (MPC) algorithm which has been proven to provide superior regulation for these processes. The controller is easy to apply due to its unique process modeling method based on Laguerre polynomials, with most applications installed in less than two weeks.},

	title = {Development of {Operation} {Strategies} for {Variable} {Speed} {Ball} {Mills}},
	abstract = {Mineral processing productivity relates to a range of operating parameters, including production rate, product grind size, and energy efficiency. Variations in ore properties and operating conditions change the comminution dynamics, resulting in a constant deviation from operational goals. Although most processing facilities currently use fixed speed grinding mills, variable speed drive is considered to provide an important control variable that can contribute to achieving operational objectives.   This thesis examines variable speed ball mill performance under changing operating conditions to recommend operating conditions for the Copper Mountain Mine. JK SimMet, a very powerful predictive tool, was used to estimate grinding circuit performance and mill power consumption. Samples and operating data were collected directly from the Copper Mountain Mine to build a calibrated model. Appearance (breakage distribution) functions of different geo-samples were measured and used to predict plant performance under different ore property variations.  The results indicate that higher mill speed and lower ball load operating strategies are preferable with respect to energy savings in variable speed ball mill operations. Ore characteristic variations at the Copper Mountain Mine are significant and can cause large oscillations within mill operations. Thus, ore blending in Copper Mountain should be done carefully and cautiously. However, in combination with traditional optimization methods, ball mill grinding speed can be used to control energy input and offset the influences of ore variability. Optimum ball mill operating conditions can be determined based on circuit design and operating dynamics for any given run-of-mine ore.  iv  Lay Summary Grinding is an important process in the mining industry that is used to break ore to a targeted size. Grinding conditions are not constant during production, and can be affected by changes in ore types and operating conditions. As drive technology develops, variable speed drives are gradually being accepted into the mining industry and are now considered an important mill speed control that can contribute to maintaining a steady product size.   In this thesis, adequate variable speed ball mill operation strategies are developed based on JK SimMet simulation results. The results indicate that variable speed drives can be used effectively as a means of controlling energy input to offset the influences of ore variability with improved comminution energy efficiency.},

	abstract = {A non-linear observer model of a semi-autogenous grinding mill is developed. The observer model distinguishes between the volumetric hold-up of water, solids, and the grinding media in the mill. Solids refer to all ore small enough to discharge through the end-discharge grate, and grinding media refers to the rocks and steel balls. The rocks are all ore too large to discharge from the mill. The observer model uses the accumulation rate of solids and the mill’s discharge rate as parameters. It is shown that with mill discharge ﬂow-rate, discharge density, and volumetric hold-up measurements, the model states and parameters are linearly observable. Although instrumentation at the mill discharge is not yet included in industrial circuits because of space restrictions, this study motivates the beneﬁts to be gained from including such instrumentation. An extended Kalman ﬁlter is applied in simulation to estimate the model states and parameters from data generated by a semi-autogenous mill simulation model from literature. Results indicate that if sufﬁciently accurate measurements are available, especially at the discharge of the mill, it is possible to reliably estimate grinding media, solids and water hold-ups within the mill.

"mineral processing industry in particular has yet to take full advantage of model-based advanced process control" (le Roux et al 2017:27)
"One of the main impediments to implementing model-based control in the mineral processing industry, and specifically grinding mill circuits, is the lack of sufficient real-time measurements to estimate the necessary model states and parameters." (le Roux et al 2017:27)
"the peripheral tools of the control loop such as observers and soft sensors become as important as the controller itself" (le Roux et al 2017:27)
"Models aimed at plant design are generally not suited for model-based control, and vice-versa" (le Roux et al 2017:27)
"Steady-state phenomenological models, a combination between theoretical and empirical models, are well established and have proven valuable for comminution plant design and steady-state optimisation" (le Roux et al 2017:27)
"The model parameters are generally divided into the ore to be processed and the comminution unit processing the ore" (le Roux et al 2017:27)
"results from laboratory tests used to estimate ore specific parameters do not necessarily reflect the range of ore breakage conditions in industrial" (le Roux et al 2017:27)
"Results indicate that if sufficiently accurate measurements are available, especially at the discharge of the mill, it is possible to reliably estimate grinding media, solids and water hold-ups within the mill. Such an observer can be used as part of an advanced process control strategy." (le Roux et al 2017:27)
"sampling campaigns used to estimate the processing unit's parameters assume steady-state operation at a specific operating point, but steady-state is difficult to guarantee over a long period given the variation of run-of-mine ore characteristics." (le Roux et al 2017:28)
"Because of the heavy reliance on back-calculation, small measurement errors can lead to large variances in parameters" (le Roux et al 2017:28)
"fundamental models remain too computationally intensive to be used in advanced process control strategies" (le Roux et al 2017:28)
"empirically derived linear time-invariant transfer function models have been successfully applied in model-based controller strategies to industrial circuits" (le Roux et al 2017:28)
"However, these linear models are restricted to the domain around the nominal operating points of the plant and require constant management to accommodate variations in grinding conditions" (le Roux et al 2017:28)
"to estimate ore, water, and ball inventories. A commercialised soft-sensor is described by Herbst and Pate [25 ] to estimate mill inventories and breakage rates. In all cases a Kalman filter is used to estimate the unknown state vector." (le Roux et al 2017:28)
"observability analyses to ensure the filters produce reliable solutions" (le Roux et al 2017:28)
"The SAG mill model of Napier-Munn et al. [9 ] was used to describe the grinding process, along with a novel ball charge model and a mill-liner model. Using measurements of the mill charge weight and size-by-size solids discharge, Apelt et al. [26 ] used 29 measurements to estimate 37 states and 7 parameters with an extended Kalman filter (EKF)." (le Roux et al 2017:28)
"As shown by Le Roux and Craig [27 ], it is theoretically possible to uniquely fit the simplified non-linear grinding mill circuit model of Le Roux et al. [28] to real-time plant measurements. However, the algebraic fitting procedure is too sensitive to uncertainties in measurements as the procedure involves the calculation of first and second order time-derivatives from noisy data" (le Roux et al 2017:28)
"The model of Coetzee et al. [29 ] is used by Olivier et al. [30] to estimate the mill inventories and grinding environment parameters in simulation. Assuming measurements of the mill discharge are available, a dual particle filter is used to estimate the hold-up of balls, rocks, solids, fines, and water as states, and the fraction of rock entering the circuit and the power needed per tonne of fines produced as parameters" (le Roux et al 2017:28)
"Since the grinding performance of a mill depends on the hold-up of steel balls, ore, and water, control of these three hold-ups can reduce the variance in the throughput and quality of the mill's product" (le Roux et al 2017:28)

"The measurements used by the reduced observer model are the total volumetric filling, the mill discharge flow-rate, the mill discharge density, and the derivative of the mill discharge density" (le Roux et al 2017:28)
"Although instrumentation at the mill discharge is not yet included in industrial circuits because of space restrictions, this work motivates the benefits to be gained from including such instrumentation" (le Roux et al 2017:28)
"To illustrate the effectiveness of the observer, a simulation study using an EKF is presented" (le Roux et al 2017:28)
"Results indicate that the modelled states can be reliably estimated if sufficiently accurate measurements are available." (le Roux et al 2017:28)
"Slurry pool conditions should be avoided as they decrease the mill power draw and the breakage rate by cushioning material falling from the charge shoulder to the charge toe." (le Roux et al 2017:29)
"The combined mass of the mill and of the charge inside the mill is generally measured using either load cells or bearing pressure. Because this is not a direct measurement of JT , the relation between JT and a mass measurement needs to be determined whenever a mill survey is performed" (le Roux et al 2017:30)
"The calibration exercise should be repeated at reasonable intervals as the loss of liner mass through wear and tear will cause a drift in the accuracy of the relationship. Once the drift in the data is quantified, an empirical liner wear model can be constructed to predict the service life of liners and adjust the relationship between the mass measurement and JT over time" (le Roux et al 2017:30)
"Because of space restrictions at the discharge trommel of the mill, inclusion of flow and density instrumentation at the mill discharge is not yet a viable reality" (le Roux et al 2017:30)
"In the case where the mill discharges into a sump, !Q and Q can be back-calculated from a flow-balance if all other inflows and outflows are measured, but this is sensitive to the accuracy of measurements at the sump" (le Roux et al 2017:30)
"Although JB is not measured directly, it can be approximated inferentially using models and measurements of Pmill or JT" (le Roux et al 2017:30)
"Generally a linear relationship between the rock volume and ball abrasion rate is assumed. This assumption allows for the calculation of MFB to maintain an approximately constant JB in terms of the tonne of ore milled" (le Roux et al 2017:30)
"The aim of the observer is to use the variables listed in Table 1 as measured quantities to estimate the mill states, the discharge rate constant, and the ore and ball breakage rates." (le Roux et al 2017:30)
"The constituents in the mill are modelled as four volumetric quantities: water (xw ), solids (xs ), rocks (xr ), and balls (xb )" (le Roux et al 2017:30)
"The cumulative breakage rate function is defined as the rate per unit mass that a given species coarser than a given size breaks to below that size [37 ]. This is an advantage over other population balance models which require two functions, a breakage rate and an appearance function, to describe grinding kinetics" (le Roux et al 2017:31)
"A disadvantage of this approach is that the cumulative rate of breakage of ore above a given size si is assumed to be unaffected by the grinding environment and the detailed structure of the size distribution above si" (le Roux et al 2017:31)
"Empirical relationships are required to relate the parameters of the cumulative breakage rate function to variations in the milling environment" (le Roux et al 2017:31)
"more sophisticated models face similar problems where the parameters of both the breakage rate and breakage distribution function vary according to changes in the grinding environment" (le Roux et al 2017:31)
"the consumption of rocks (RC) and balls (BC) in the population balance of (2b) to (2d) are described as RC = xr Kr (3a) BC = xb Kb ," (le Roux et al 2017:31)
"The mill discharge model for the observer is adapted from the model presented in Morrell and Stephenson [44], where the discharge of charge from the mill through the end-discharge grate is viewed as a product of two mechanisms: the fluid transport through the grate, and the solids classification by the grate which differentiates between ground particles either returning to the milling chamber for further grinding or becoming part of the mill discharge stream." (le Roux et al 2017:31)
"Therefore, the discharge of the water (Vwo ) and solids (Vso ) in (2a) and (2b) can be expressed as Vwo= "(xw+ xs )xw (10a) Vso= "(xw+ xs )xs ." (le Roux et al 2017:32)
"For this study, it is assumed that measurements of JT , Q and !Q are available" (le Roux et al 2017:32)
"kP is a lumped power draw parameter to account for heat losses due to internal friction, energy for attrition and abrasion breakage and rotation of grinding media, plus inaccuracies associated with the assumptions and measurements of the charge shape and motion" (le Roux et al 2017:32)
"PC as an empirical function of JT and the mill charge density (!C )" (le Roux et al 2017:32)
"Ideally !C could be inferred from the measurement of Pmill using the power draw model in Apelt et al. [36 ]. However, to use the model, parameter kP in (12) must be fitted to process data. This fitting process requires !C to be known. Therefore, the observer model does not make use of Pmill as an output equation as it only introduces additional parameters to estimate." (le Roux et al 2017:32)
"the dimension of the observability codistribution dO was determined using Maple.1 The dimension of dO at a generic point x0 is 7 , which implies that the non-linear system is locally (weakly) observable" (le Roux et al 2017:33)
"A longer time horizon for the MHE reduces the validity of modelling the parameters as constants, but a shorter time horizon may not include sufficient system dynamics for the observer to estimate the unknown states and parameters" (le Roux et al 2017:33)
"From an analysis of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix A it can be seen that the three unknown parameters (", Kr , Kb ) each contribute an integral mode to the linearised system" (le Roux et al 2017:33)
"Because of this repeated mode, two of the three parameters need to be chosen in the linearised model for the other parameter to be linearly observable" (le Roux et al 2017:33)
"To achieve linear observability, the model in (16 ) is reduced based on the assumption that the dynamics of the slurry (xw and xs ) is much faster than the dynamics of the grinding media (xr and xb )" (le Roux et al 2017:34)
"The observability matrix O of the pair (C, A) has full column rank. Therefore, all states and parameters are observable" (le Roux et al 2017:34)
"The SAG mill simulation model of Le Roux et al. [28] was developed with the aim to produce reasonably accurate model responses using as few parameters and states as possible. The model was validated using industrial plant data" (le Roux et al 2017:35)
"The model divides the ore into the same two size classes as used in the observer model. Therefore, the mill inflow flow-rates are the same as in (1), and the population balance of the model is the same as in (2)." (le Roux et al 2017:35)

The slurry solids are allowed to settle and then the depth of solids is measured. All measurements are relative to ball level, not absolute slurry level, which for an overflow mill is a function of the discharge trunnion diameter" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1488)"If the solids are well below the ball level, with a watery layer above, then the mill is under-loaded with slurry. If there is a solid settled layer above the balls then the mills are overloaded" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1488)"For single stage SAG/AG mills the slurry level should be just below the charge level, to maximise fine grinding.

(Powell and Mainza 2006:1489)"When snapshot surveys are combined with the single-point sizing technique, 4-8 conditions can be established in one (often long) day, depending on the size and residence time of the mill, and unplanned changes in mill feed." (Powell and Mainza 2006:1489)"Almost all of a ball mills power draw is determined by the ball loading, with variation in the ore loading contributing only a few percent" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1489)"For general pilot work, as opposed to a specially calibrated and usually cantilevered mill with a high level of accuracy in torque measurement (Pietsch, 1972), the variation in power draw with ore loading in the mill is lost in the noise of the power measurement" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1489)"Austin et al. (1984) showed that both underloading and overloading of ore in the ball mills lead to low breakage rates which result in lower grinding efficiencies" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1489)"For an overflow ball mill the slurry level is consistent, but the solids loading in the slurry can vary widely" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1489)"when different milling conditions, such as ball size, mill filling, grinding media shape, discharge mechanism, slurry density, etc. are tested at a constant mill feedrate, the differences in mill performance can be almost completely absorbed by changes in mill voidage, when some of the conditions lead to under-filling of the mill" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1489)"it was found that there does not appear to be a reliable standard pilot milling technique that would address these issues." (Powell and Mainza 2006:1489)"To the surprise of the investigators it was found that the chosen feedrate was at the tail end of the mill performance" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1490)"At lower feedrates the scats have a considerably coarser grind which drops off and flattens right up to 850 kg/h, before dropping to its lowest value" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1490)"By chance the pilot trials had been conducted at the throughput where the two trends crossed over" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1490)"What is more, it can be deduced that the optimal operating point of the pilot mill is at 600 kg/h, just prior to the dropoff in fineness of grind" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1490)"a decision has to be made on what conditions to conduct trials at when investigating the performance of a SAG mill for the first time" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"Generally the input of the operator, plant records, and some short term step tests to check the response of the mill can be used to help determine the most favourable test conditions" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"Often the standard operating conditions are opted for by default. This strategy can be useful for setting up a base case model of the mill, but when testing the influence of changing some particular variable, for example feed type or size distribution, the results can be as misleading as the example of inappropriate ball mill pilot tests" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"It can also be the case that mill operators run a mill at a particular filling, speed, percent solids, etc. more by default than design" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"Many a site has hung tenaciously onto an historically established good operating regime, despite major changes to ore, liner design, ball load etc., resulting in the mill operating well off its peak performance potential." (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"This is often an issue to be addressed in consulting optimisation work." (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"For a SAG mill there are many variables against which a grindcurve can be developed. The ones that can be most readily varied, and are common control parameters, are mill speed, mill filling, and percent solids" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"As the ideal percent solids can generally be established up front (as described earlier), and many mills have a fixed speed, the mill filling is the most common parameter to vary in developing a grindcurve" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"A critical part of developing a filling grindcurve is establishing the relationship between percent filling of the mill and an external load measurement, such as load cells, bearing back pressure, or power when the other two are lacking" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"It is essential that the filling is accurately known, and this can only be assessed through entering the mill to physically measure the filling" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"The authors record for a standard four point measurement (to provide a reliable average along the mill) from mill stop to restart is 12 min, including lockout and safe entry procedures" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"A key to this is using a laser tape measure, a rugged Hilti surveyors unit, accurate to 1 mm and with a 100 m range is used by the authors. This enables accurate and rapid height and diameter measurements in any size mill" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"A critical parameter in the load filling relationship, and in modelling a mills performance, is the ball load, and this should be established through grindout" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"The filling data at the end of the grindout provides an excellent extreme point in the filling-load curve, and helps to give an accurate curve fit" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"For a grindcurve covering 5-6 conditions, 2 crash stops and the grindout to measure ball filling are sufficient to establish the filling calibration" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"Convenient tests during the snapshot are chosen for the crash stop calibrations. For the remainder of the snapshot tests the filling is calculated from the calibration curve. Accuracies of 0.3\% filling can be attained." (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"It has been found that the gradual adjustment of feedrate in small steps is the most rapid path to a new filling and feedrate" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1492)"An example of an excellent grindcurve that was established as part of the P9N AMIRA test work conducted at the AngloGold Ashanti Kopanang site," (Powell and Mainza 2006:1492)"The grindcurves show how the power, throughput, and circuit product vary with mill filling." (Powell and Mainza 2006:1492)"The resultant grindcurves were used to establish the ideal conditions for the research test work. In addition the grindcurve is a production tool, which can be used to select the optimal target operating conditions" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1492)"It is also operationally more stable to remain T ( o \% M" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1492)"below the power peak, rather than seeking back and forth over the peak and drifting into periods of poor operation.

"Semi-Autogenous Grinding mills can be optimized for maximum ore throughput or maximum grinding energy efficiency" (Gough 2015:2)
"In both cases, precise control of the mill weight is critical" (Gough 2015:2)
"Model predictive control provides an additional tool to improve the control of Semi-Autogenous Grinding mills and is often able to reduce process variability beyond the best performance that can be obtained with proportionalintegral-derivative or expert system control methods" (Gough 2015:2)
"Mineral processing operations present many challenges for automatic process control due to variations in unmeasured ore properties, material transport delays, and nonlinear response characteristics" (Gough 2015:2)
"Maintaining the SAG mill weight at the optimum value is critical for achieving maximum grind rate efficiency and mill production (Powell, M.S., van der Westhuizen, A.P., \& Mainza, A.N. 2009)" (Gough 2015:2)
"SAG mill weight is difficult to control as the dynamic response changes as the mill approaches maximum capacity. Near maximum capacity, the weight response exhibits integrating behavior, and the mill can overload quickly" (Gough 2015:2)
"This situation is complicated by the transport delays in the feed system, so it is important that the control system can detect the imminent overload and adjust the feed rate quickly to prevent an overload" (Gough 2015:2)
"Expert systems are a popular approach to manage the control of these difficult processes in the mining industry" (Gough 2015:2)
"For SAG mill control, expert systems are often used as they are able to detect the rapid increase in mill weight and anticipate an imminent overload using combinations of rules" (Gough 2015:2)
"However they often reduce the feed rate more than necessary in some situations, and require time to return the feed rate to maximum levels, which decreases production capacity" (Gough 2015:2)
"Developing the expert system rules to manage the dynamic response of a process is not a simple task. The rules must manage error from the target as well as the rate of change of the process" (Gough 2015:2)
"If measured disturbance variables such as pebble recycle, ore feed size distribution or mill rotation speed are also included in the control design, then the expert rules become even more complex" (Gough 2015:2)
"Adjusting these rules to obtain optimal control response under all situations is difficult because there is no theoretical basis for determining these settings. This leads to a trial and error approach with uncertain dynamic control performance results" (Gough 2015:2)
"MPC is often able to reduce process variability beyond the best performance that could be obtained with PID or expert system control methods" (Gough 2015:3)
"MPC is able to manage applications where there are delays in the process response to actuator changes or multiple interactions between process variables" (Gough 2015:3)
"In particular, MPC is able to optimize the control of processes that exhibit an integrating type response in combination with transport delays or variable interaction" (Gough 2015:3)
"This type of response is particularly difficult to control, and it is common in mineral processing for many different processes including level control of flotation cells and crushers, and SAG mill weight control" (Gough 2015:3)
"Unlike the rulebased control approach of expert systems, MPC performance can be predicted and optimized in a systematic manner that ensures the dynamic control results are as expected" (Gough 2015:3)
"MPC has been successfully applied to SAG mill control at several copper mines in South America" (Gough 2015:3)
"MPC consistently demonstrated the ability to provide reduced process variability and increased stability compared to PID or expert system based control" (Gough 2015:3)
"Obtaining a process response model is a key part of the implementation of an MPC controller" (Gough 2015:3)
"In our design, the controller models the system response using a generic function series approximation technique based on Laguerre polynomials" (Gough 2015:3)
"This approach provides a simple and efficient method to mathematically model the process response with a minimum of a priori information" (Gough 2015:3)
"enables the controller to perform online adaptation of the process response models automatically, which is not possible when using models based on a simple open loop time series" (Gough 2015:3)
"The adaptive capabilities assist the control technician with developing the process response models, and the default configuration of the control parameters ensures excellent control performance once the process model is obtained" (Gough 2015:3)
"These factors reduce the implementation effort and contribute to quick installation times" (Gough 2015:3)
"Using these models as the basis for a predictive control design, the MPC is able to control processes with long delay or response times" (Gough 2015:3)
"This technique can also be used to automatically model and counteract the effects of measured disturbances by incorporating them into the control strategy as feed forward variables" (Gough 2015:3)
"The use of feed forward variables is particularly important for long time delay systems so that disturbances can be cancelled much sooner than is possible using feedback control alone" (Gough 2015:3)
"(Zervos \& Dumont, 1988). They proposed the use of a state-space model derived from Laguerre orthogonal basis functions so that process response model identification and adaptive control could be achieved without the need to know the process order or the time delay in advance" (Gough 2015:3)
"This method is efficient due to the similarity of the basis functions in the series to the signal being modeled, and also due to the special mathematical property of the basis functions called orthogonality that ensures a unique solution of the basis function weighting coefficients in the identified model" (Gough 2015:3)
"In process control, the process transfer functions are transient in nature and are not periodic, so Cosine functions are not an appropriate choice as a basis for the model structure. However, the elegance of the Fourier series technique provides many advantages such as simple and efficient model structure and excellent parameter convergence when estimating the model from observed data sets due to the orthogonality property of the Fourier series. The motivation of this research was to find an equally simple and efficient method to model the transient responses common in process control applications." (Gough 2015:4)
"The Laguerre functions are well suited to modeling the types of transient signals found in process control because they have similar behavior to the processes being modeled and are also an orthogonal function set" (Gough 2015:4)
"In addition, the Laguerre functions are able to efficiently model the dead time in the process response compared to other suitable function sets" (Gough 2015:4)
"After the process response model is obtained, a predictive control design is used to calculate the actual output actions of the controller" (Gough 2015:4)
"This concept of predictive control involves the repeated optimization of a performance objective over a finite horizon extending from a future time (N1) up to a prediction horizon (N2)" (Gough 2015:4)
"For applications of the MPC that involve just a single control output, a deterministic control law can also be obtained using a simple d-steps ahead process response prediction with a single step control horizon. In this case, the complexity of the design is greatly simplified and the control output can be calculated directly without the use of a search-based optimizer or a least squares calculation" (Gough 2015:5)},

	abstract = {Autogenous (AG) milling is utilised around the world for particle size reduction. The system exhibits highly non-linear behaviour in addition to being subject to unmeasured variability associated with most ore bodies. Anglo American Platinum aimed at improving online optimisation of the circuit by implementing industrial model predictive control (MPC) to reduce system variability and continuously drive towards the optimal operating point within system constraints. The industrial dynamic matrix controller commissioned on the AG mill with a variable speed drive resulted in a 66\% reduction in power and a 40\% reduction in load standard deviation. These are the main controlled variables of the mill. The controller also improved the objective function, effective power utilisation, by 11\%. This reduction in operated variable variability enabled a test campaign where the mill was controlled at various operating regions in order to establish the conditions conducive to the finest product size at a given mill feed rate. Moving the mill operating region from the benchmarked plant to the optimal grind environment and stabilising the mill at this point with the model predictive controller provided an estimated potential recovery increase of 0.32\% (absolute) due to better liberation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"Optimal control theory has had very limited application in mineral processing practice. The reason for this has been the lack of accurate on-line models, the complicated nature of the mathematics and a lack of inexpensive computing power" (Herbst et al 1988:275)
"This is true because of the highly variable nature of feed materials, frequent mechanical disturbances in a plant and the presence of strongly interacting variables which can and often are manipulated simultaneously in any given control strategy" (Herbst et al 1988:275)
"These problems do in fact provide the basis for rich opportunities through dynamic optimization" (Herbst et al 1988:275)
"In the past, optimization of a process was usually associated with finding the optimum steady state inputs and automatic control was usually associated with the stabilization of the process and the two areas (optimization and automatic control) were not connected" (Herbst et al 1988:275)
"it is possible to dynamically optimize a process with a control strategy in order to adapt to changes in feed materia or operating condition" (Herbst et al 1988:275)

"the optimum gain constants for proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers depend upon the character of the ore and operating condition" (Herbst et al 1988:276)
"PID controllers in a grinding circuit can be tuned for very fast response when the ore is soft but when the ore is hard the controller gains will have to be reduced since the reaction of the grinding circuit to control actions is increased and the possibility of overload is greater" (Herbst et al 1988:276)
"Optimal control, in contrast, incorporates mathematical models into the control strategy so that information about interactions, process parameter variations and other disturbances is available in order to provide the best possible control performance" (Herbst et al 1988:276)
"an example of the application of optimal control to an industrial rod/ball mill circuit is presented" (Herbst et al 1988:276)

"modeling errors are introduced since the real process is subject to unknown random disturbance" (Herbst et al 1988:280)
"This controller is also known as a linear quadratic gaussian (LQG) controller since it minimizes a quadratic performance index for a stochastic linear system with gaussian statistics" (Herbst et al 1988:280)
"The Kalman filter estimator is a powerful means to obtain an on-line estimate" (Herbst et al 1988:280)
"The Kalman filter does this by optimally combining model predictions and measurements to yield an improved estimate" (Herbst et al 1988:280)
"A critical source of model error originate from the linearization of the nonlinear model and depends upon how the linearization is performed" (Herbst et al 1988:280)

A continuous-time grinding mill circuit model is presented with a hydrocyclone cluster as the primary classifier. The discrete-time component is the switching of hydrocyclones in the hydrocyclone cluster. The resulting model is a hybrid non-linear model with both continuous and discrete dynamics. A simulation of the HNMPC shows the advantages of using the hydrocyclone cluster as an additional manipulated variable. The advantages of the HNMPC is illustrated by comparing its performance to a non-linear MPC where no switching of hydrocyclones is possible. The genetic algorithm based HNMPC showed increased controller stability in its ability to incorporate discrete dynamics into the controller directly. The methods discussed in this paper can be used to incorporate different types of discrete dynamics into advanced grinding mill circuit controllers due to the modular presentation of the model and HNMPC controller design.},

"Single loop PID controllers do not allow for any trade-off between the control objectives" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"Therefore, if one of the loops hit a constraint, the other loops cannot attempt to offset the resulting set-point error" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"A variety of multivariable controllers were developed to achieve the optimal trade off between the control objectives and improvements in product quality, throughput, and power consumption" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"The design of advanced multivariable controllers involves identifying additional MVs to improve the circuit's operating region" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"In Craig et al. (1992) the range of quality control was increased by independently manipulating the mill's water feed-rate instead of fixing the water feed-rate as a ratio of the ore feed-rate" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"Similarly in Botha et al. (2015) the range of quality control was increased by manually switching cyclones in a hydrocyclone cluster" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"Power consumption reduction while maintaining quality was achieved in Estrada (2014) by alternating between different stockpiles as ore feed and whether a secondary grinding stage is used or not" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"In Naidoo et al. (2014) and Le Roux et al. (2016) the mill speed is used as an additional MV to reduce mill power consumption, and to independently control quality and throughput" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"One of the most common advanced process control methods is model predictive control (MPC)" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"Non-linear MPC (NMPC) follows the same principle of operation as a linear MPC, except a non-linear model is used to predict the plant outputs and the solver should be able to cope with possible local minima and non-linear models" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"The controller was capable of controlling over a larger operating region than linear MPC controllers" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"The key drawbacks in using model based predictive controllers is model mismatch because of the difficulty to estimate model parameters and complex solutions with unrealistic execution intervals" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"technological improvements (in the form of multi-core processors) have made it possible to implement non-linear MPC controllers with complex models in real time" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"Hybrid model predictive control (HMPC) is capable of controlling a process by predicting according to continuous and discrete-time events, and manipulating continuous and discrete components" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"The work in this study builds on Botha et al. (2015) where the benefits of switching hydrocyclones in and out of a cluster are shown" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"The controller benefits from a larger operating region due to the non-linear model, and being able to switch the discrete components thereby further increasing the operating region" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"A closed single-stage grinding mill circuit with a hydrocyclone cluster" (Botha et al 2018:51)
"qualitatively accurate and can be used for predictive controller design" (Botha et al 2018:51)
"In Xiao et al. (2010), Esmin et al. (2005) the HMPC controller used particle swarm optimisation (PSO) to solve the objective function" (Botha et al 2018:56)
"The genetic algorithm (GA) is a solver that has shown advantage over solvers such as PSO because of its ability to accommodate strong non-linearities, large variations in initial "guess" inputs, mixed integer dynamics (with various switching components) and convergence to a global minimum in the presence of many local minima" (Botha et al 2018:56)
"During the dynamic simulation the HNMPC showed promise in switching cyclones to maintain operating setpoints" (Botha et al 2018:59)
"the HNMPC can anticipate when switching is required and can therefore reject disturbances more quickly" (Botha et al 2018:59)
"Over the duration of the simulation the PSE performance for the HNMPC was double that of the NMPC as the average particle size error squared was halved with the HNMPC" (Botha et al 2018:59)
"transport delays were omitted" (Botha et al 2018:59)
"ideal sensors and actuators were assumed" (Botha et al 2018:59)
"full-state feedback was used" (Botha et al 2018:59)
"Implementing an HNMPC is similar to implementing an NMPC which is becoming easier to implement due to the increased availability of suitable vendor platforms" (Botha et al 2018:60)
"What remains a challenge is to accurately model the plant to be controlled, and to keep this model up to date" (Botha et al 2018:60)
"The key contribution as shown in this study was that there is underlying benefit in incorporating discrete process input variables in the controller formulation" (Botha et al 2018:60)
"The benefits noted were improved stability and improvements in throughput when manipulating the switching of hydrocyclones in a cluster" (Botha et al 2018:60)},

"Grinding mill circuits are difficult nonlinear processes to control because of the coupling and interaction between process variables" (Aguila-Camacho et al 2017:80)

"The aims of this survey are to determine how milling circuits are currently controlled, and to find out how key process variables are linked to economic benefits" (Wei and Craig 2009:56)
"The primary objective of control systems is to maximise benefits" (Wei and Craig 2009:56)
"systematic procedure for the economic assessment of process control, was proposed in Bauer and Craig (2008)" (Wei and Craig 2009:56)
"that the product particle size, slurry level in the sump, and sump discharge slurry density are the three most frequently used controlled variables." (Wei and Craig 2009:57)
"The mill load and slurry level in the sump are usually open-loop unstable, requiring some form of control" (Wei and Craig 2009:57)
"The flow rate of water to the sump, flow rate of water to the mill, feed rate of solids to the mill, and flow rate of slurry from the sump are all frequently adopted as manipulated variables" (Wei and Craig 2009:57)
"The efficiency of the downstream process is of primary importance (89\%). Circuit throughput is also an important factor (53\%)." (Wei and Craig 2009:57)
"Two main actions taken to grind finer than expected are to decrease the feed rate of solids to the mill and to increase the flow rate of water to the sump. These actions are mainly performed manually (62\%)" (Wei and Craig 2009:57)
"the stability of the system is the first priority (78\%). Maintaining a margin of safety is the second choice (67\%)." (Wei and Craig 2009:57)
"The most frequent action taken, when the sump level is too low, is to increase the feed rate of water to the sump (47\%). To reduce the feed rate of slurry from the sump discharge is of secondary importance (39\%)." (Wei and Craig 2009:57)
"When the sump level is higher than the setpoint, most (94\%) of the respondents indicated that spilled slurry needed to be handled, which would lead to some costs. When the sump level is lower than the setpoint, the largest percentage of the respondents state it will adversely affect the normal operation." (Wei and Craig 2009:57)
"efficiency of power consumption is the first priority (80\%) when considering the choice of the setpoint of the mill load. The stability of the system is also regarded as an important factor (67\%)." (Wei and Craig 2009:58)
"The most frequently taken action, when a mill load is too low, is to increase the feed rate of solids to the mill (73\%). In some milling circuits, the mill speed is decreased (29\%) or water addition to the mill feed is reduced (27\%)." (Wei and Craig 2009:58)
"When the mill load is too high, stoppage of the mill to reduce the load and thus interrupting production is chosen by 47\% of the respondents." (Wei and Craig 2009:58)
"When the mill load is too low, the largest percentage of the respondents (87\%) indicated it would lead to excessive ball-on-liner contact and therefore to damage of the mill liners. Consuming more steel and a decreased throughput are both regarded as serious consequences. Around half of the respondents stated that a too low mill load would result in a waste of power." (Wei and Craig 2009:58)
"The stability of the system is the first priority when determining the setpoint of the sump discharge slurry density (53\%)" (Wei and Craig 2009:58)
"Avoiding cyclone choking is also considered significant by 41\% of the respondents." (Wei and Craig 2009:58)
"When the sump discharge slurry density is too low, the three most frequently taken actions are to decrease the flow rate of water to the sump, to increase the feed rate of solids to the mill, and to reduce the flow rate of water to the mill" (Wei and Craig 2009:58)
"These actions are primarily conducted automatically" (Wei and Craig 2009:58)
"When the density is too high, downstream process inefficiency and decreased production" (Wei and Craig 2009:58)
"impact is primarily the potential wastage of reagents in downstream processing and losses in recovery" (Wei and Craig 2009:58)
"mill load and the mill power are regarded as dependent by over half of the respondents" (Wei and Craig 2009:59)
"particle size and the mill load, and the particle size and the density of slurry of the sump discharge." (Wei and Craig 2009:59)
"The majority of the respondents use PID control (63\%)" (Wei and Craig 2009:59)
"Multivariable control and expert system-based control are less frequently used but more often than other control technologies." (Wei and Craig 2009:59)
"main contributors to the benefits of a process control system. Process stability improvement was regarded as the primary contributor (71\%). Throughput increase and energy consumption reduction are also seen to be main contributors" (Wei and Craig 2009:59)
"past experience with similar projects is more often used (86\%). Before control variance estimation is another frequently used method (78\%)" (Wei and Craig 2009:59)
"As for the methods of calculating the benefits when the control system is in place, in most of the milling circuits (89\%), experiments are conducted where respondents switch between the old and new control system" (Wei and Craig 2009:59)
"The main contributors are control hardware, consultant manpower cost, and cost of technology" (Wei and Craig 2009:59)
"This is in contrast to results reported in Bauer and Craig (2008) where manpower cost was dominant and control hardware played a lesser role." (Wei and Craig 2009:59)
"The three variables that are most frequently controlled are the product particle size, the slurry level in the sump, and the sump discharge slurry density." (Wei and Craig 2009:60)
"The most commonly used manipulated variables are the flow rate of water to the sump, the flow rate of water to the mill, the feed rate of solids to the mill, and the flow rate of the sump discharge slurry." (Wei and Craig 2009:60)
"More than half of the respondents indicated that controlled variables were dependent on each other" (Wei and Craig 2009:60)
"PID controllers are predominantly used in the grinding mill plants, and more than half of the respondents are satisfied with the performance of their control loops" (Wei and Craig 2009:60)

	abstract = {A conventional grinding circuit consisting of one open-loop rod mill and one closed-loop ball mill is essentially a two-input= twooutput system, assuming that the classifier pump box level is controlled by a local loop. The inputs are the ore and water feed rates and the outputs are the product fineness and the circulating load. The design problem is to find a control algorithm and a tuning procedure which satisfy specified servo and regulatory robust performances. A first approach is to use decentralized PID controllers and systematic tuning methods which take into account loop interactions. Another technique consists of adding decouplers or pseudo-decouplers to the decentralized controllers. Finally, the design of a fully multivariable controller is a possible option. To face the problem of performance robustness related to change of process dynamics, two options are studied. A design criterion involving the minimization of a penalized quadratic function on a future trajectory can be used. A second alternative is to track process dynamics changes using adaptive process modelling. The paper will present a comparison of these various strategies, for a simulated grinding circuit. A benchmark test, involving a sequence of disturbances Žgrindability, feed size distribution, change of cyclone number . . . . and setpoint changes, is used to compare the performances of the controllers. q 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

"The objective of this paper is to study the performances of various control algorithms acting on a grinding circuit in face of different disturbances and setpoint changes" (Pomerleau et al 2000:103)
"w x have studied this control problem, it is hard to compare the results since the benchmarks are different" (Pomerleau et al 2000:103)
"The grinding process is a size reduction operation used in the mineral industry to liberate the valuable minerals from the discardable gangue" (Pomerleau et al 2000:103)
"Two local controllers are assumed to be part of the process. Sump level is maintained at a constant value using a variable speed pump controlled by a PID. The percentage of solids in the feed is kept around a desired set-point using a feed water addition rate proportional to the fresh ore feed rate" (Pomerleau et al 2000:103)
"Grinding typically represents around 50\% of the total expenditure of the concentrator operation" (Pomerleau et al 2000:103)
"influences the efficiency of the valuable minerals recovery process" (Pomerleau et al 2000:104)
"The true objective of grinding is to obtain a proper liberation of the minerals coupled with a proper particle size distribution in order to maximize recovery and concentrate value without overgrinding, while keeping specific comminution energy and reagent consumption as low as possible, taking into account the prevailing economic conditions" (Pomerleau et al 2000:104)
"These objectives being highly complex, simpler ones must be formulated." (Pomerleau et al 2000:104)
"Generally, as the liberation degree cannot be measured on line, the production objective is to maintain at a set-point value the percentage of the product particles smaller than the reference size" (Pomerleau et al 2000:104)
"tons per hour of solids . is to be maximized. High recirculation at a fixed product size means lower energy consumption" (Pomerleau et al 2000:104)
"Excessive circulating load can result in classifier, mill or pump overload conditions" (Pomerleau et al 2000:104)
"The selected controlled variables are therefore the size distribution and the circulating load" (Pomerleau et al 2000:104)
"The fresh ore feed rate and the water addition to the sump box are the available manipulated variables." (Pomerleau et al 2000:104)
"Since industrial design and testing are costly, the dynamic grinding circuit simulator DYNAFRAG is used" (Pomerleau et al 2000:104)
"It simulates the mineral processing plant with appropriate set of mass balance equations for the pulp, the water and the particles of .." (Pomerleau et al 2000:104)
"From 100 to 150 simultaneous differential equations are to be solved." (Pomerleau et al 2000:104)

"The "process" and the "control room" are physically separated. They are both simulated on their own micro-computer and are interconnected through digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital interfaces" (Pomerleau et al 2000:104)
"From these transfer functions, one concludes that a grinding" (Pomerleau et al 2000:105)
"circuit is a highly coupled process where PBW addition has a very fast short-term effect on the size distribution, but where the RMF has the dominating long-term effect." (Pomerleau et al 2000:105)
"In a structure where the decoupler is explicitly expressed as shown in Fig. 5, a decoupler structure has to be chosen and the facility of decoupling depends on the choice of the coupling used." (Pomerleau et al 2000:105)
"The controller tuning of the SISO controllers is done on the combined system including the process and the decoupler" (Pomerleau et al 2000:105)
"The first studied algorithm is the standard decentralized PID controller which is usually the reference to compare different algorithms" (Pomerleau et al 2000:106)
"PID controllers present some drawbacks. First, their performances are limited by the properties of the fixed structure.

At Siilinjärvi, outlet slurry of the grinding circuit is measured with a high precision on-line laser diffraction based slurry particle size analyzer. In this study, process experiments for modeling of the grinding circuit were carried out. Then multivariablePI, fuzzy, and model predictive controls were evaluated with the simulated process.

"In this study, process experiments for modeling of the grinding circuit were carried out. Then multivariablePI, fuzzy, and model predictive controls were evaluated with the simulated process" (Remes et al 2010:70)
"A recent survey on the control of grinding circuits confirmed that the majority of them are equipped only with PID controllers; but still MPC implementations— among other multivariable control systems— exists (Wei and Craig, 2008)" (Remes et al 2010:70)
"Pomerleau et al. (2000) used mass balance based grinding circuit simulator to study the performance of various particle size and circulating load controllers, from decentralized PID (with or without decoupling) to adaptive predictive control, with setpoint and disturbance sequences" (Remes et al 2010:70)
"Firstly, the characteristics of different ore types, excavated from various deposit locations, were studied" (Remes et al 2010:71)
"he ore type affects through the process, in terms of grindability andfloatability, which especially depends on the apatite grain size" (Remes et al 2010:71)
"tofind out the impact of the variations in the ore feed characteristics on the plant performance, a data set comprising six months hourly averages (May-Nov. 2007) were analyzed" (Remes et al 2010:71)
"The data set was studied by means of clustering. Prior to that, the data was compressed tofive principal components (PC), explaining 78\% of the original variance" (Remes et al 2010:71)
"Grindability depends greatly on the ore type having different compositions of the apatite, carbonates and phlogopite; thus grinding energies can vary from 5 kWh/t up to 7 kWh/t." (Remes et al 2010:72)
"The circuit product particle size distribution was monitored with an on-line Outotec PSI 500TM particle size analyzer" (Remes et al 2010:72)
"Tofind out the dynamic responses of the grinding circuit to the changes in the control variables, a series of step response experiments was carried out while running several individual ore feed heaps" (Remes et al 2010:72)
"The grinding circuit models were identified and validated based on several experiment data sets. Thefinal on-line implemented models were still verified with separate step test sequences" (Remes et al 2010:73)
"The resulting transfer function models are presented in Table 2" (Remes et al 2010:73)
"Three common multivariable control schemes were evaluated for the Siilinjärvi grinding process. The selected methods were multivariable PI control as a base case, a fuzzy control, from which earlier practices has been gained as a part of apatiteflotation control, and, finally, a model predictive control, which also has embedded implementation capabilities in the current Metso DNA plant automation system" (Remes et al 2010:74)
"The fuzzy control was constructed by defining trapezoidal membership functions for the selected input and output variables, completed with a Mamdani type rule base inference system." (Remes et al 2010:74)
"For an introduction to fuzzy systems, see for example Lin and Lee (1996)." (Remes et al 2010:74)
"The rule base and fuzzy sets were carefully tuned in an iterative manner, by means of simulations, to obtain well approved inputoutput performance." (Remes et al 2010:74)
"The third option, model predictive control (MPC) utilizes the dynamic process models to make predictions of the future process values and to calculate future controller outputs to obtain optimal output trajectory for the setpoint tracking" (Remes et al 2010:75)
"The control performance was evaluated in terms of integrated squared error index (ISE), presenting the squared control error of the time period" (Remes et al 2010:75)
"To emulate the measurement conditions in reality, white noises for the particle size and circulating load (\%) measurements were added" (Remes et al 2010:75)
"The model predictive control was implemented as a receding horizon control with one minute control interval, 10 min control horizon and 40 min prediction horizon, covering the required process stabilization time." (Remes et al 2010:75)
"robustness of the model predictive control to model mismatches was evaluated. In practice, the model mismatches occur when the process equipment conditions change and when the ore types vary" (Remes et al 2010:76)
"Based on the set point tracking results shown in Table 5, the FuzzyMPC scheme was selected for long term process data simulation." (Remes et al 2010:76)
"Strong interactions between the process variables set challenges to the modeling task; it turned out that the most suitable model structures were transfer functions defining the input output dynamic separately for each variable." (Remes et al 2010:77)
"The control development, tuning, and performance evaluation were conducted in a simulation environment, established based on the experimental dynamic models" (Remes et al 2010:77)
"from the viewpoint of long term maintenance, fuzzy control is based on readily manageable rule base" (Remes et al 2010:78)
"Also, fuzzy control is well suited for discrete control actions, such as valve opening and closing, used here for control of the circulating load" (Remes et al 2010:78)
"A relatively long (one week) process data simulation with a fuzzyMPC scheme confirmed the advantages of closed loop particle size control" (Remes et al 2010:78)
"During the whole period the control system reduced variation of the coarse fraction 67\%, and even during one feed ore heap the reduction was 26\%, while keeping the circulating load in operating limits by automated manipulation of the hydrocyclone valve pattern." (Remes et al 2010:78)
"Moreover, the ore feed rate increased an average 1.8\% within the data period. Apparently, better control of the slurry particle size distribution has a favorable impact onflotation recovery, possibly still increasing the plant capacity" (Remes et al 2010:78)
"this control assessment gives a proper insight for forthcoming grinding circuit control strategy implementations." (Remes et al 2010:78)},

	abstract = {Ball mill grinding circuits are essentially multi-variable systems characterized with couplings, time-varying parameters and time delays. The control schemes in previous literatures, including detuned multiloop PID control, model predictive control (MPC), robust control, adaptive control, and so on, demonstrate limited abilities in control ball mill grinding process in the presence of strong disturbances. The reason is that they do not handle the disturbances directly by controller design. To this end, a disturbance observer based multi-variable control (DOMC) scheme is developed to control a two-input-two-output ball mill grinding circuit. The systems considered here are with lumped disturbances which include external disturbances, such as the variations of ore hardness and feed particle size, and internal disturbances, such as model mismatches and coupling effects. The proposed control scheme consists of two compound controllers, one for the loop of product particle size and the other for the loop of circulating load. Each controller includes a PI feedback part and a feed-forward compensation part for the disturbances by using a disturbance observer (DOB). A rigorous analysis is also given to show the reason why the DOB can effectively suppress the disturbances. Performance of the proposed scheme is compared with those of the MPC and multi-loop PI schemes in the cases of model mismatches and strong external disturbances, respectively. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method has a better disturbance rejection property than those of the MPC and PI methods in controlling ball mill grinding circuits.},

"An offset-free controller is one that drives controlled outputs to their desired targets at steady state" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:617)
"most widely used industrial MPC implementations assume a constant output disturbance that can lead to sluggish rejection of disturbances that enter the process elsewhere" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:617)
"This paper presents a general disturbance model that accommodates unmeasured disturbances entering through the process input, state, or output" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:617)
"Closed-loop performance of model-based control algorithms is directly related to model accuracy" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:617)
"In practice, modeling error and unmeasured disturbances can lead to steady-state offset unless precautions are taken in the control design" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:617)
"Elimination of steady-state offset is accomplished in two basic ways" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:617)
"The first method involves modifying the controller objective to include integration of the tracking error" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:617)
"For large-scale systems, this augmentation can significantly increase the computational cost of the dynamic optimization which grows in proportion to the cube of the state dimension" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:617)
"Another disadvantage of this approach is the requirement of an anti-windup algorithm for the integral term to prevent an unnecessary, and sometimes costly, performance penalty" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:617)
"A second general approach to eliminating steady-state offset involves augmenting the process model to include a constant step disturbance" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:617)
"This disturbance, which is estimated from the measured process variables, is generally assumed to remain constant in the future and its effect on the controlled variables is removed by shifting the steady-state target for the controller" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:617)
"it has the disadvantage of requiring that a separate disturbance model be designed and the disturbance states estimated" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:617)
"The constant state disturbance model is a standard technique in linear quadratic regulator design" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:617)
"The output disturbance is estimated in a manner that implicitly assumes perfect, noise-free measurements" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:618)
"While this method has proven to be acceptable for stable plants, it does not work for unstable systems because the observer poles contain the unstable poles of the process model" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:618)
"Even for stable systems, this method may lead to unacceptable performance if the sensors are noisy or if disturbances enter the plant elsewhere" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:618)
"The main contribution of this paper is to provide guidelines for the design of a general state-space disturbance model for linear model predictive control" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:618)
"Guidelines for disturbance model design are then presented in the form of theoretical results that guarantee the existence of a detectable disturbance model and outline the conditions necessary for detectability of the augmented system" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:618)
"the desired controlled variable target if an unmeasured, constant disturbance enters the process or if model error is present" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:619)
"In most implementations of MPC technology, this problem is solved by incorporating a constant output disturbance into the process model" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:619)
"A constant output disturbance model can be constructed using the following augmented state-space model" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:619)
"The main disadvantage is that the state dimension is increased in the dynamic optimization which increases the computational cost" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:619)
"The output disturbance model in Eq. (5) is simple to implement but may lead to poor performance when a disturbance enters elsewhere in the loop" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:619)
"a PID controller can outperform the typical industrial MPC implementation when a disturbance enters the input of a process upstream of a dominant lag" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:619)
"Morari and Lee [14] suggest representing the output disturbance as a ramp to improve the rejection of input disturbances" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:619)
"Another alternative is to augment the system model with an input or state disturbance" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:619)
"Closed-loop controller performance is directly related to how accurately the disturbance model represents the actual disturbances entering a process" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:619)
"This subject is discussed by Francis and Wonham [33] for linear multivariable systems and has become known as the internal model principle" (Muske and Badgwell 2002:619)

"The design of optimal controllers for processes subject to stochastic disturbances has received considerable attention in the literature (Box and Jenkins 1970, Astrom 1970" (MacGregor et al 1984:390)
"The controllers are derived under the assumption that the stochastic disturbances are the major disturbances in the system" (MacGregor et al 1984:390)
"Although most processes have some stochastic disturbances, in many cases they are not the major disturbances in the system" (MacGregor et al 1984:390)
"The major upsets in the process are often due to deterministic disturbances such as sudden step changes, ramps, or exponential changes to new levels," (MacGregor et al 1984:390)
"These may occur randomly in time due to sudden unexpected loads on the system or due to unanticipated set-point changes made by operators on some control loops in the system" (MacGregor et al 1984:390)
"As with any optimal control problem, in order to solve it, we need to have a model not only for the process dynamics but also for the disturbances for which we desire to compensate" (MacGregor et al 1984:390)
"It is shown here that sampled deterministic disturbances occurring infrequently, but at random times, can be represented by the same structural form of model as the ARIMA stochastic models-the only difference being in the probability distribution assumed for the random shocks (a,) that drive the models" (MacGregor et al 1984:390)
"the linear quadratic optimal-control laws for processes subject either to ARIMA stochastic disturbances or to randomly occurring deterministic disturbances are shown to be identical for models of the equivalent structure" (MacGregor et al 1984:390)
"These results enable us to assess how well a controller designed to handle a disturbance from one class of disturbances (e.g., stochastic) will perform in the presence of a particular disturbance from the other class (e.g., deterministic" (MacGregor et al 1984:390)
"We start by considering models for some of the simpler, more common disturbances such as steps, ramps, and exponential rises to new levels, and then we generalize the model to include almost any structure" (MacGregor et al 1984:391)
"Step Disturbances" (MacGregor et al 1984:391)
"Probability Density Function" (MacGregor et al 1984:391)
"Most of the probability density is located at zero (99\% of it if one expects, on the average, only one step every 100 sampling intervals), and the remainder is distributed perhaps as a normal distribution centered on zero" (MacGregor et al 1984:391)
"Ramp Disturbances" (MacGregor et al 1984:391)
"General Model for Randomly Occurring Deterministic Disturbances" (MacGregor et al 1984:392)
"state-variable form of representation" (MacGregor et al 1984:392)
"capable of modeling most randomly occurring deterministic disturbances that might be encountered in practice" (MacGregor et al 1984:393)
"deterministic disturbances that occur at random times can be modeled by the general difference equation models" (MacGregor et al 1984:393)
"These have the same structure as the general ARIMA and state-space models that have been commonly used to model stochastic disturbances" (MacGregor et al 1984:393)
"The only difference lies in the distribution of the shocks" (MacGregor et al 1984:393)
"we will be concerned with representing the disturbance as it appears in the output" (MacGregor et al 1984:393)
"3.1 Minimum Mean Squared Error Control" (MacGregor et al 1984:393)
"Since the complementary function (f2(B)at) is identical for ARIMA stochastic disturbances (N,) and for randomly occurring deterministic disturbances (D,) of the same structure, then, obviously, the linear MMSE controller will be identical for these dual disturbance processes" (MacGregor et al 1984:394)
"As an example, the MMSE controllers for a stochastic random-walk disturbance and for a randomly occurring step disturbance are identical" (MacGregor et al 1984:394)
"For such deterministic disturbances, minimum-variance control is equivalent to what is called minimal-prototype or deadbeat control" (MacGregor et al 1984:394)
"often the stochastic models obtained from the process identification study over a short time period represent only minor disturbances or noise in the output, and the major disturbances for which control is necessary are deterministic in nature" (MacGregor et al 1984:394)
"In this case one would logically discard the ARIMA stochastic model and design the controller using the model appropriate for the particular randomly occurring deterministic process" (MacGregor et al 1984:394)
"As in the case of stochastic disturbances, MMSE control for deterministic disturbances can call for very large variations in the manipulated variable" (MacGregor et al 1984:394)
"Therefore, we may want to design a controller subject to a constraint on the sum of squares of the control settings" (MacGregor et al 1984:394)
"By using discrete transfer-function models together with the deterministic disturbance models (2.13), it can be shown that the solution to this problem is exactly that obtained by the spectral factorization method (Wilson 1970 and Whittle 1963) for the equivalent ARIMA stochastic disturbance model" (MacGregor et al 1984:394)
"If the elements of at, have distributions as illustrated in Figure 1, then the controller minimizing (3.7) or (3.8) would be nonlinear, and its solution is intractable for all but the most trivial cases" (MacGregor et al 1984:395)
"To develop these control schemes one must be able to build models for the process and for the disturbances" (MacGregor et al 1984:395)
"When only stochastic disturbances are present, the parametric time-series methods (Box and Jenkins 1970 and Astrom 1970) for building joint dynamic-stochastic models have proven to be very useful" (MacGregor et al 1984:395)
"When the system is relatively free of stochastic disturbances, the identification of a transfer-function model for the process is readily accomplished by using one of the traditional non-parametric identification methods, such as direct step testing (Rake 1980), Fourier analysis (Rake 1980), correlation methods (Box and Jenkins 1970), or spectral analysis (Jenkins and Watts 1968)" (MacGregor et al 1984:395)
"Models that are capable of characterizing the randomly occurring deterministic disturbances in the output can then be obtained by one's direct knowledge of the nature and source of these disturbances (e.g., step changes are to be made in set points, or occasional step changes in an input variable lead to exponential type behavior in the output)" (MacGregor et al 1984:395)
"Alternatively, since the process is relatively free of stochastic disturbances, the nature of these deterministic disturbances can be observed directly in the output records" (MacGregor et al 1984:395)
"since the models for these two types of disturbances can be represented by the same type of ARIMA difference equation structure, then their sum should be approximated by a model of this structure as well" (MacGregor et al 1984:397)
"Time series identification methods (Box and Jenkins 1970) could, therefore, be used on data containing a mixture of both types of disturbances to identify an approximate ARIMA model for their combined effect on the output" (MacGregor et al 1984:397)
"no real distinction should be made between optimal stochastic control and optimal control for deterministic disturbances that may occur randomly in time" (MacGregor et al 1984:398)},

"a restricted MJLS representation is considered for describing a wide class of commonly seen disturbances" (Wong and Lee 2007:234)
"This HMM approach has hitherto found limited use for disturbance modeling. Robertson and Lee (1998) proposed a special kind of Markovian jump disturbances for the modeling of abrupt changes but there, the focus was on state estimation" (Wong and Lee 2007:234)
"This contribution is chie∞y to demonstrate the viability of restricted MJLS's as a model structure suitable for a wide spectrum of interesting disturbance signals" (Wong and Lee 2007:234)
"0 It has been shown (Vidal et al., 2002) that for general MJLS's there exists y an inØnite number of combinations of dis- -300 crete and continuous state cardinalities that will give the same input-output behavior" (Wong and Lee 2007:237)
"MLE optimization is typically non-convex; the likelihood surface is fraught with multiple optima. As such, the EM algorithm converges to the nearest stationary point" (Wong and Lee 2007:237)

"In system identification temporal information is often used only to construct the input samples (or regressors) and outputs, but then it is neglected. For example, in estimating autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX), the regressor is a finite collection of current and past signal observations, but the order of the regressor/output pairs is irrelevant when least squares are used" (Bemporad et al 2018:11)
"On the other hand, there are many applications in which relevant information is contained not only in data values but also in their temporal order" (Bemporad et al 2018:11)
"if the time each data-point was collected is taken into account, one can detect changes in the type of regime the data were produced" (Bemporad et al 2018:11)
"All these examples are characterized by the need of fitting multiple models and understanding when switches from one model to another occur" (Bemporad et al 2018:11)
"Piecewise affine (PWA) models attempt at fitting multiple affine models to a dataset, where each model is active based on the location of the input sample in a polyhedral partition of the input space" (Bemporad et al 2018:11)
"In some cases, mode transitions are captured by finite state machines, for example in hybrid dynamical models with logical states, where the current mode and the next logical state are generated deterministically by Boolean functions" (Bemporad et al 2018:11)
"In spite of the difficulty of assessing whether a switched linear dynamical system is identifiable from input/output data (Vidal, Chiuso, \& Soatto, 2002), a rich variety of identification methods have been proposed in the literature" (Bemporad et al 2018:11)
"Hidden Markov models (HMMs) treat instead the mode as a stochastic discrete variable, whose temporal dynamics is described by a Markov chain" (Bemporad et al 2018:12)
"Natural extensions of hidden Markov models consider the cases in which each mode is associated with a linear function of the input" (Bemporad et al 2018:12)

"In this paper we consider rather general jump models to fit a temporal sequence of data that takes the ordering of the data into account" (Bemporad et al 2018:12)
"The proposed fitting algorithm alternates two steps: estimate the parameters of multiple models and estimate the temporal sequence of model activation, until convergence" (Bemporad et al 2018:12)
"When we impose no constraints or penalty on the model sequence, our method reduces to automatically splitting the dataset in K clusters and fitting one model per cluster, which is a generalization of K -means" (Bemporad et al 2018:12)
"Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are a special case of jump models" (Bemporad et al 2018:12)

"In control systems jump models can be used to approximate nonlinear/discontinuous dynamics and design model-based control policies, state estimators, and faultdetection algorithms" (Bemporad et al 2018:13)
"We discuss a few options for choosing the mode loss functions Linit ,Lmode ,Ltrans defining the mode sequence loss" (Bemporad et al 2018:13)
"K must be chosen as a trade off between fitting the model to data (K large) and limit the complexity of the model and avoid overfitting (K small)" (Bemporad et al 2018:13)
"The shape of the increasing finite sequence \{Lmode (i)\}K=1 can be used to reduce the number of possible modes" (Bemporad et al 2018:13)

"We provide now algorithms for fitting a jump model to a given dataset and to infer predictions ˆyt , ˆst from it" (Bemporad et al 2018:15)

"However, there is no guarantee that the solution found is the global one, as it depends on the initial guess S 0" (Bemporad et al 2018:15)
"The same fitting objective (12) can be used to estimate ˆyt and ˆSt = (ˆs0 , . . . , ˆst )" (Bemporad et al 2018:15)
"Clearly, while producing exactly the same results, the formulation in Algorithm 3 is much more efficient than Algorithm 2, as the number of computations does not increase with t and thus can be used for online inference" (Bemporad et al 2018:16)
"This allows reconstructing the mode sequence ˆs1 , . . . , ˆs ̃ recurT sively from the available dataset, which may be useful for example to detect changes in the relation between the input ̃xt and the output ̃yt" (Bemporad et al 2018:16)
"Jump models have several common features with hidden Markov models (HMMs)" (Bemporad et al 2018:16)
"Indeed, an HMM is a special case of a jump model" (Bemporad et al 2018:16)
"both models consider the presence of discrete latent states st" (Bemporad et al 2018:16)
"While HMMs assume that the sequence S of such states satisfies the Markov property p(st {\textbar}st −1 , . . . , s0 ) = p(st {\textbar}st −1 ) in jump models the particular form chosen in (13a) for the mode sequence lossL makes estimating ˆst incrementally as in (29) possible" (Bemporad et al 2018:16)
"jump models are more descriptive than HMMs. The sequence of modes may not be generated by a Markov chain, such as in the case of PWA models (10) and (11), where the mode st is a deterministic function of xt" (Bemporad et al 2018:17)
"In addition, the loss and mode loss functions can have rather arbitrary shapes" (Bemporad et al 2018:17)
"We test the algorithms proposed in the previous sections on various problems of regression and classification using jump models." (Bemporad et al 2018:17)
"In all the examples, convex optimization methods are used to solve the problem at Step 1.1 of Algorithm 1, while dynamic programming is used to compute the global optimum at Step 1.2" (Bemporad et al 2018:17)

"We have presented a new framework for fitting a jump model to a temporal sequence of data" (Bemporad et al 2018:20)
"Overall, the approach is able to fit models with latent discrete variables and provides an efficient (and more general) alternative to existing methods, such as the expectation-maximization algorithm for the estimation of hidden Markov models and cluster-based heuristics for the identification of switching and PWA models." (Bemporad et al 2018:20)
"A main strength of the approach is its versatility in describing a large class of parametric models, as the shape of the model and the way it jumps depends on the shape of the loss functions used for fitting the model parameters and for inference" (Bemporad et al 2018:20)
"Although there is no guarantee of converging to the global optimum, numerical evidence shows the effectiveness of the method" (Bemporad et al 2018:20)},

Causes of plant-wide disturbances include non-linear limit cycles in control loops, controller interactions and tuning problems. The diagnosis of non-linearity, especially when due to valve stiction, has been an active area. Detection of controller interactions and disturbances due to plant structure remain open issues, however, and will need new approaches. For the future, the linkage of data-driven analysis with a qualitative model of the process is an exciting prospect. Finally, the paper offers some brief comments about emerging applications.},

"the increasing share of wind generation in the power system energy mix can bring unwanted consequences, mainly due to the stochastic nature of wind power" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:234)
"In order to study the impact of wind generation to the power system, time series of the power output of the wind plants are used, usually obtained by a procedure consisting of two distinct steps: the utilization of data and information on the stochastic prime mover (wind activity) and the subsequent transformation of the wind activity to power output" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:234)
"In order to capture the wind stochasticity, recordings for a sufficiently long period should be used. However, because the data records typically are of short length, it can become necessary to use stochastic simulation techniques for the derivation of synthetic time series for the modeling of the wind activity" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:234)
"even one year of measured high-quality data can be entirely insufficient to estimate the statistical properties of the stored energy content" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:234)
"even 20 years of data are insufficient to obtain accurate estimates of loss of load probability" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:234)
"The necessity to at least have at hand a suitable method to simulate stochastic power time series from measured data becomes more urgent as systems to be designed based on stochastic sources become more complex, more densely meshed with a higher penetration of inert distributed resources to support the stochastic generation facilities such as storage, demand side management facilities, or backup generation" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:234)
"the wind speed is typically the basis for the investigation" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:234)
"Due to the complexity in deriving the detailed power curve, in most cases, a less accurate wind speed/wind power curve is used as the input-output characteristic" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:234)
"The output of this two-step procedure is a time series of the power fed to the grid connection point" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:234)
"In this paper, we propose the development of a synthetic wind power model from measured data directly in the power domain and show that this procedure offers basic advantages over modeling procedures in the wind speed domain" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:234)

"Stochastic models of the power output of a wind plant are more simple than the ones concerning wind activity, mainly due to the type of the transformation of the wind stochastic process into power" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:235)
"f (v) is a relation in the standard working range of the turbine" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:235)
"Methods for the synthetic generation of wind time series have to mimic the major statistical properties of the recorded data, namely the probability density function (pdf) and the autocorrelation function (acf) as closely as possible" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:235)
"Two basic methodologies for the synthetic generation of time series may be found in the related literature: the classical timeseries analysis with autoregressive (AR) models and the MCMC techniques" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:235)
"Both methods present different advantages and disadvantages, making them suited for different applications" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:235)
"Classical time-series analysis involves the generation of synthetic stationary time series based on the combination of the AR and moving average (MA) models for the stochastic pro- 2 cess" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:235)
"The basic advantage of the methodology is that by" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:235)
"the definition of a relatively small number of parameters, the AR and ARMA models allow for controlled synthetization of a desired acf" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:236)
"however, does not hold for the pdf; in general, the pdf of the generated time series does not match the one of the measured data. Such a pdf mismatch can lead to wrong estimates of the energy yield of the process, and consequently, to wrong calculation of power flow densities with basic implications on system design" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:236)
"For the synthetic generation of time series consistent with both basic statistical properties (i.e., pdf and acf), the MCMC method may be used instead" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:236)
"The application of the method involves the discretization of the stochastic process into a number of states and the definition of the probabilities for the transitions between states" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:236)

"This is a basic problem that renders the applicability of higher order MC models: the more states used for the representation of the initial process, the more cases of low information encountered in the model, leading to a poorer model quality" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:238)
"MCMC on the Wind Power Domain" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:238)
"by estimatingP after the transformation of the wind speed through the wind turbine curve, we achieve a significant reduction in the number of states without losing any information" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:238)

"The estimated wind power transition matrixP is illustrated in Fig. 5." (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:238)
"wind power time series show a lower persistence than the wind speed ones. This means that the same stochastic model in the wind power domain is achieved by a lower order Markov chain" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:238)
"The FO-MC, however, does not always serve for a satisfactory reproduction of the acf. This is the case for highly volatile signals, where the lag-1 time step is only "part of the truth" about the persistence of the time series" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:238)
"For verification, we generated a synthetic wind power time series based on TS A, for MC models of different orders, in the wind power domain" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:239)

"the method is" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:239)
"suitable for reproducing the two basic statistical wind power parameters with sufficient accuracy" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:239)
"it is shown that the direct generation of wind power time series based on the MCMC is superior to indirect synthesization of wind power via artificial wind speeds" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:239)
"The MCMC is the method that provides results consistent to the nonstandard pdf and the respective acf for the modeling of the stochastic output of the wind plant" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:239)
"Future extensions of this paper will directly treat such data instead of wind speed data as the input for the identification process" (Papaefthymiou and Klockl 2008:239)

This paper addresses the problem of maximuma-posteriori estimation of jump BJ models from a given training input/output dataset. The proposed solution method estimates the coefficients of the BJ submodels, the state transition probabilities of the Markov chain regulating the switching of operating modes, and the corresponding mode sequence hidden in the dataset. In particular, the posterior distribution of all the unknown variables characterizing the jump BJ model is derived and then maximized using a coordinate ascent algorithm. The resulting estimation algorithm alternates between Gauss–Newton optimization of the coefficients of the BJ submodels, a method derived based on an instance of prediction error methods tailored to BJ models with switching coefficients, and approximated dynamic programming for optimization of the sequence of active modes. The quality of the proposed estimation approach is evaluated on a numerical example based on synthetic data and in a case study related to segmentation of honeybee dances.},

Instead, we assume that the controller relies only on an output y(k) and a measured variable ���̂���(k) coming from a detector that provides the only information of the Markov chain ������(k). To solve the problem, we resort to an iterative method that starts with a state-feedback controller and solves at each iteration a linear matrix inequality optimization problem.

The effectiveness of the iterative procedure is illustrated by means of two examples in which the conservatism between the upper bounds and actual costs is significantly reduced.},

Since these disturbances occur infrequently in time, traditional filtering methods (e.g., Kalman filter, EKF) which assume identically distributed noise terms may not yield acceptable performance. The reason for this is that, when tuning the filter, a compromise must be made between sensitivity to noise and the ability to track these disturbances when they do occur. The stochastic model of these disturbances leads to a multi-filter approach for the state estimation. Since the number of filters grows exponentially with the data length, a suboptimal algorithm is required. The performance of this approach is evaluated for state/parameter estimation of a continuous polymerization reactor.},

The performance of this approach is evaluated for state/parameter estimation of a heptane to toluene aromatization process. The method is also shown to be robust to errors in the assumed noise statistics. 0 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Existing linear, stationary disturbance models are oftentimes limiting in the face of time-varying characteristics typically witnessed in process industries. These include intermittent drifts, abrupt changes, temporary oscillations, and outliers. This work proposes a Hidden-Markov-Model-based framework to deal with such situations that exhibit discrete, modal behavior. The usefulness of the proposed disturbance framework is demonstrated through two examples: i) tracking abruptly changing feed conditions in the context of a second generation bioethanol fermentor and ii) tracking stiction, a well known problems known to occur in valves.},

"a system subject to component/subsystem failures and possibly to repairs and system reconfiguration. Such systems can be thought of as possessing random structure which changes randomly at random points in time as a consequence of the failures; note that these changes are abrupt" (Tugnait 1982:607)
"In this paper we are concerned with the problems of system state estimation and system structure detection given noisy observations on the system state" (Tugnait 1982:607)
"Linear discrete-time systems with abrupt changing (jump) parameters modelled as a finite state Markov chain are considered" (Tugnait 1982:607)
"Motivation for considering models with jumps stems from applicability of such models to a large class of realistic problem" (Tugnait 1982:607)
"The partitioning approach, also called the multiple-model approach, has been used to devise adaptive state estimation as well as control algorithms for systems having unknown constant parameter" (Tugnait 1982:607)
"Modelling with Markov jump parameter may be thought of as an extension of the partitionin approach in that, in the former, we allow switchings among the hypothesized models unlike the multiple model approac where a candidate model is assumed to describe the true system behavior for all time" (Tugnait 1982:607)
"In several applications switching parameter modelling is more realisti" (Tugnait 1982:607)
"Failures in components or subsystems of a dynamical system can be represented by abrupt changes in the system parameter" (Tugnait 1982:607)
"For a system with gross nonlinearities, many different linearize models must be used to obtain coverage of the system over its entire dynamic range. Therefore, the nonlinear system is approximated by a model which switches (according to a Markov, or a semi-Markov chain) among a set of linearize versions of the given nonlinear system" (Tugnait 1982:607)
"Jumps in the measurement noise covariance may represent outlier" (Tugnait 1982:607)
"At any time the system parameters assume one of a finite number of possible values according to a Markov chain; thus the system structure may be thought of as being random" (Tugnait 1982:607)

The minimum variance estimate for the state involves consideration of a prohibitively large number of sequences, so that the usual computation method becomes impractical. In the algorithm proposed here, the estimate is calculated with a relatively small number of sequences sampled at random from the set of a large number of sequences. The average risk of the algorithm is shown to converge to the optimal average risk as the number of sampled sequences increases. An ideal sampling probability yielding a very fast convergence is found. The probability is approximated in a minimum mean squared sense by a probability according to which sequences can be sampled sequentially and with great ease. This policy of determination of sampling probability makes it possible to design practical and efficient algorithms. Digital simulation results show a good performance of the proposed algorithm.},

These difﬁculties are well recognised in the literature, resulting (for example) in extensive study of subspace-based techniques, as well as recent interest in ‘data driven’ local co-ordinate approaches to gradient search solutions. The paper here proposes a different strategy that employs the expectation–maximisation (EM) technique. The consequence is an algorithm that is iterative, with associated likelihood values that are locally convergent to stationary points of the (Gaussian) likelihood function. Furthermore, theoretical and empirical evidence presented here establishes additional attractive properties such as numerical robustness, avoidance of difﬁcult parametrization choices, the ability to naturally and easily estimate non-zero initial conditions, and moderate computational cost. Moreover, since the methods here are maximum-likelihood based, they have associated known and asymptotically optimal statistical properties.},

	title = {Recursive optimal estimation for a class of non-{Gaussian} processes},
	abstract = {This paper deals with the recursive calculation of the conditional mean estimator for the state of linear discrete time systems driven by non-Gaussian noise. It is motivated by the fact that difficulties with the Kalman estimator are often not the result of system nonlinearities (which are dealt with adequately by the linearizing techniques of Mowery and Cox), but of non-Gaussian drivers. The approach taken is to approximate the driving noise density by a sum of Gaussian terms. An exact recursive expression for the conditional mean is then developed. The expression involves terms (nonlinear in the observations) whose number grows exponentially with the length of the observed sequence. Several approximations to the conditional mean estimate, which require constant (rather than increasing) computational and storage load, are suggested. These approximations, two of which rely on concepts from the field of Hypothesis Testing, may be considered adaptive filters. An example of the application of these approximation is given. In all cases, retention of a sufficient number of terms in the approximation results in mean square errors smaller than those of the optimum linear estimator. When the energy of the driving noise is large in comparison to that of the observation noise, and when the driving noise density is poorly described by a Gaussian function, the difference between the mean squared error performance of these estimates and the optimal linear estimate can be considerable.},

upper and lower finite limit (e.g., interest rates). It is not 
possible to say that these time series are random walks because 
random walks are limitless with probability one (as time goes 
to infinity). Yet, some of these time series behave just like 
random walks. In this paper we propose a new approach that takes 
into account these ideas. We propose a discrete-time and a 
continuous-time process (diffusion process) that generate bounded 
random walks. These paths are almost indistinguishable from 
random walks, although they are stochastically bounded by an 
upper and lower finite limit. We derive for both cases the ergodic 
conditions, and for the diffusion process we present a closed 
expression for the stationary distribution. This approach suggests 
that many time series with random walk behavior can in fact 
be stationarity processes.},

Several adaptive control algorithms are now available and many industrial applications have been performed in the field of chemical engineering and more recently in the field of particulate processes. This paper gives an overview of discrete adaptive controllers. It presents qualitatively the underlying control design and discusses the recursive least-squares estimation algorithm with requirements for long-term parameter tracking. Particular emphasis is put on the design assumptions and several adaptive control applications in the particulate process field are given.

"An optimal circulating load target has been found by steady-state optimization of the grinding circuit tunings." (Najim et al 1995:64)
"P r o d u c t fineness and circulating load have been selected as controlled variables. Two manipulated variables are available: ore feedrate (tons/h) and water addition (m3/ h) to the sump box and ball mill" (Najim et al 1995:64)
"t h e sump level is regulated using the pump speed in a PI loop, while water addition to the rod mill is controlled proportionally to the fresh ore feedrat" (Najim et al 1995:64)
"Th e simulator DYNAFRAG is able to simulate some of these disturbances and also to add random disturbances to the actuators and sensors" (Najim et al 1995:65)
"T h e system response time is about 1 h. Circulating load and product fineness exhibit slight initial inverse responses for water addition and fresh ore feedrate, respectively. Product fineness shows a particular behaviour, where the initial response to water addition is extremely nervous while the longer term effect is small" (Najim et al 1995:65)
"Two different pairing of the variables are possible. The control of the particle size with the water addition is selected since, as indicated by the open-loop response, the product quality, which is the main output to be controlled, responds quickly and with an initial high gain to the water feedrate." (Najim et al 1995:65)
"Thi s leaves the ore feedrate to control the circulating load as the second loop" (Najim et al 1995:65)
"I t is of major importance to realize that the dynamic open-loop relationship between ul and Yl and between u2 and Y2 are completely modified when the other loop is closed, because of the strong interaction effects ul -Y2 and u2-y{\textasciitilde}" (Najim et al 1995:65)
"T h e open-loop behaviour of Fig. 3(b), for instance, does not help to find polynomials A, B and C of Eqs. (7) and (8) that are needed to design the controller of the loop u{\textasciitilde}-YlThis is one basic reason for using on-line model parameter estimation." (Najim et al 1995:65)
"On e can imagine that it would be possible to close the on-loop and to identify the open-loop model of the other loop. However, the estimated model would no longer be valid when the controller tuning of the closed loop is changed. This is one additional reason for using adaptive control when dealing with distributed monovariable control loops." (Najim et al 1995:65)
"F u r t h e r mo r e , the process dynamics also may change so that, at constant controller tuning the controller may lose its efficiency if it is not adaptive." (Najim et al 1995:65)
