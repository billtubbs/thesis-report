	abstract = {With increased pressure for companies to cut costs during design of new mineral processing plants, overall plant design has changed over the last decade with less surge capacity installed and less design for feed blending. This has changed the dynamics and operability of new SAG and AG comminution circuits, where disturbances due to direct tipping of feed and recycle crusher operation have resulted in the evolution of control of SAG and AG mills to utilise new advanced control techniques. These techniques are necessary to maintain stability and optimise the performance of the new SAG and AG comminution circuits. This paper describes advances in the operation and control of new SAG mill installations in Australia. The case studies show the difficulties in operability and control of grinding circuits where direct tipping and ore type variations, coarse ore feeder trips and low surge capacity in the recycle crushing circuit are present. The case studies also describe the benefits of applying the new control techniques in these applications for both open and closed circuit SAG comminution circuits.},

	title = {Development {Of} {A} {Tower} {Mill} {Model} {Using} {Hardgrove} {Mill} {Tests}},
	abstract = {The gravity-induced low speed stirred milling technology, commonly referred to as tower mills, are widely used for fine grinding due to their high energy efficiency compared to conventional tumbling mills. Moreover, the lower operating cost, shorter installation period and simpler operating strategy make it attractive for many mines. Researchers have attempted to develop an ore characterization method and mathematical models for tower mills. However, there is no well- established universal fine material characterization method for both the grindability assessment and modeling of tower mills. In this study, a modified Hardgrove mill fine material characterization method was developed for the tower mill grindability assessment. The test result was integrated into the fmat breakage model, which incorporates both the effect of specific energy and particle size. Several industrial tower mill grinding circuit surveys were conducted to provide the information regarding the operating conditions and grinding product size distribution. The ore breakage model, the size specific energy level model, internal classification model and tower mill power models were integrated into a mass-size balance model to simulate the tower mill performance. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to simulate the tower mill performance under varied stirrer speed and media charge. Results obtained from the model and simulation work show that the developed model is capable of predicting the tower mill grinding product size distribution with adequate accuracy. The sensitivity analysis indicated a new opportunity to control the tower mill performance by adjusting the stirrer speed rather than by the conventional media addition strategy.},

	title = {Improving advanced control for better mineral throughput, size classification and {Cu} recovery},
	abstract = {A reliable advanced control system is vital for continuous and effective operation. Therefore, AMSA-Los Pelambres has implemented an ongoing learning process that allows for continuous improvement of the control system and the process itself. In order to optimize mineral processing, the main control objectives have been identified by process area. The primary grinding control task is to minimize SAG specific energy consumption; the secondary grinding must deliver optimal liberation size while rougher flotation control should aim to maximizing Cu recovery. To better meet these demands, two advance control layers were devised, implemented and tested. The lower layer objective is to stabilize the process based on model predictive control tools, chosen by its good stability, convergence and handling of delays. The upper layer aims to optimizing the process targets, while at the same time is collecting information for decision making in order to increase performance and automatically adapt its conditions to changing ore and/or process conditions. To find such optimal operation points, years of process information were thoroughly studied using Big Data techniques. In particular, a SAG mill phenomenological model was developed to account for variables that cannot be measured in real time. For secondary grinding, a virtual particle size sensor was designed by studying classification performance. Similarly, a dynamic compensator control technique was designed by studying classification performance. Similarly, a dynamic compensator control technique was designed to adjust rougher flotation upstream and downstream cell levels. After several months of operation, preliminary results show an increase in throughput up to 2\%, decreased P80 up to 30 microns and increased recovery up to 2\%. This is a significant advance because - by adapting itself to changing process conditions, anticipating disturbances and incorporating process behavior knowledge - it can outperform known control strategies, representing thus, a further step towards towards man-less operated plants.},

	abstract = {Comminution is known to be an inefficient user of energy. This makes it the largest energy consumer in many mine sites and therefore a large component of cost. One would therefore have thought that improving comminution energy efficiency would be receiving the undivided attention of the mining industry, but this is not the case. This paper considers why this is so and what the future might hold, by posing and attempting to answer three questions: Is this really an important issue for the mining industry?If so, can comminution energy be substantially reduced in a reasonable time frame?What are the drivers that will motivate change, and what should now be done? The conclusions of the paper are pessimistic in the sense that forces may be gathering that will demand that the issue be addressed across the industry in the relatively near future, but optimistic in the sense that there is a clear development path. There is much that can be done with what is already known, and considerable promise exists in new developments which can be realised through sustained and focused R\&D, building on new knowledge acquired in the last 20 years. These are outlined in the paper. It is concluded that there is a case for a global initiative to significantly reduce comminution consumption over say the next 10 years through a partnership between all parts of industry and the research community, covering short, medium and long-term innovation.},

	abstract = {Online measurement of particle size is vital to the development of advanced control systems for comminution processes. Horizontal stirred mills, such as the IsaMill, are designed for more efficient ultrafine grinding and have made significant inroads in the mineral processing industries since their introduction more than a decade ago. Despite their energy efficiency, significant improvement is possible via more efficient control of these mills. Advanced control generally requires online information on the key performance variables of the mill. In this regard, measurement of the particle size in the mill is problematic. However, this problem can be addressed by use of soft sensors, whereby the particle size can be estimated from the measurements of other process variables. In this investigation, such a soft sensor is developed for online estimation of particle size on an industrial IsaMill in Western Australia. The sensor consists of a random forest model that uses operational variables measured online as predictors to estimate the P80particle size of the mill. Principal component analysis is used in conjunction with the random forest to enable it to assess the similarity of new process measurements to the data in its training data base. When the new data exceed a Hotelling's T2or a prediction error or Q-index threshold, recalibration of the model is automatically performed.},

	abstract = {Towards the end of the 1990s readily available personal computers became sufficiently powerful - when combined with an efficient numerical code - to use discrete element modelling (DEM) in two dimensions for models involving a few hundred to a few thousand particles in commercially available packages. Some proprietary codes reported up to 200,000 particles [Herbst, J.A., Nordell, L., 2001. Optimization of the design of sag mill internals using high fidelity simulation. In: Vancouver, B.C., Barratt, D.J., Allan, M.J., Mular, A.L. (Eds.), Proceedings of the SAG Conference, University of British Columbia, IV, 150-164; Cleary, P.W., 2001a.

Recent advances in DEM modelling of tumbling mills. Minerals Eng. 14, 1295-1319]. In early 2000, JKMRC and CSIRO-MIS agreed to an informal collaboration with the objective of testing various DEM approaches against detailed process measurements. The initial collaboration demonstrated that 3D-DEM using spheres was sufficiently realistic for flow patterns and power estimation within tumbling mills. The results were reported in papers which were presented at SAG 2001 and in the technical literature [Morrison, R.D., Cleary, P.W., Valery, W., 2001. Comparing power and performance trends from DEM and JK modelling. SAG 2001, Department of Mining and Minerals Process Engineering.

The commencement of the CRC for Sustainable Resource Processing in 2003 provided an opportunity to formalize the collaboration and bring increased resources to bear. The objective of this collaboration is to develop a virtual comminution machine (VCM). The VCM will allow a comminution machine design which exists as a suitably detailed design in a 3D Computer aided design file (CAD) to simulate processing an ore (which has been characterised by suitable test work) to predict progeny, power consumption, wear and even machine component loadings.

"DEM simulations of tumbling mills have for a long time focussed on dry processes or simply ignored the slurry content - that is, water and particles finer than a millimetre or two." (Morrison and Cleary 2008:772)
"the slurry coating of grinding media or larger pebbles (Shi and Napier-Munn, 1996) ensures that at least some fine particles are selected for breakage in every collision, this behaviour is critical to prediction of fine progeny." (Morrison and Cleary 2008:772)
"Even with today's computers in multi-processor arrays, computation of more than a very small sample of collisions at this level of detail is still a numerical impossibility and empirical approximations are required." (Morrison and Cleary 2008:772)
"there are two major continuing challenges for DEM simulations of tumbling mills - fine progeny and the behaviour of mineral slurry" (Morrison and Cleary 2008:772)
"a full scale SAG mill in 3D would require many millions of particles. Instead we have typically chosen to use slice models of full scale units" (Morrison and Cleary 2008:772)
"Fig. 2 shows a cut away view of the simulated mill including discharge grates and pulp lifters. This is a complete mill model and includes the feed end, the main/belly/circumferential lifters, the end lifters, the grate, the pulp lifters, the discharge cone and the external mill shell." (Morrison and Cleary 2008:772)
"Impact breakage on the toe of the charge has long been considered to be a dominant contributor to throughput for SAG mills." (Morrison and Cleary 2008:772)
"Fig. 3 plots DEM estimates of impacts against time for a 26 mm particle. As expected, the particle receives about one major impact (say {\textgreater} 0.05 J) per revolution of the charge" (Morrison and Cleary 2008:772)
"This confirms the "common wisdom" but also shows that" (Morrison and Cleary 2008:772)
"the energy levels are much too small to cause breakage in a single impact." (Morrison and Cleary 2008:773)
"Napier-Munn et al. (Napier-Munn et al., 1996 Chapter 5) provide a detailed description of how A and b can be measured." (Morrison and Cleary 2008:773)
"Hence, comminution models based on the concept of high energy single impact breakage events in the toe region do not reflect the reality of the collision environment actually occurring within the mill." (Morrison and Cleary 2008:773)
"Almost all freshly broken ore particles are angular in shape. Applying a force transverse to a sharp corner can remove the corner through a shear fracture in tension. As this is a low energy mode of breakage, there will be many shear events of sufficient energy and rounding is likely to happen quickly." (Morrison and Cleary 2008:773)
"Hence a particle will be well rounded soon after it enters the mill charge." (Morrison and Cleary 2008:773)
"If the surface forces are relatively low, the rounded particles then undergo a more or less constant rate of mass loss" (Morrison and Cleary 2008:774)
"A constant rate of mass loss leads to a single parameter model which can make a reasonable estimate of an AG mill load based on the feed size distribution and that parameter" (Morrison and Cleary 2008:774)
"DEM modelling in this regime (Djordjevic et al., 2006) revealed that inter-particle "friction" provided a good guide to particle mass loss in both single particle size and mixed particle sizes in this pilot scale autogenous mill for a tough quartzite ore." (Morrison and Cleary 2008:774)
"While the properties of impact breakage at high energies are reasonably well understood (as shown in Section 2), breakage of ore at the particle interaction energies available in AG/SAG mills is poorly understood." (Morrison and Cleary 2008:774)
"at higher interaction energies the rate of breakage increases rapidly as particles begin to break by what appears to be impact breakage - even though the interaction energies are much too small to cause impact breakage in a single collision" (Morrison and Cleary 2008:774)
"As exposure to a low level of impact means that a particle may or may not be broken in a single impact, the traditional tests are unable to provide reproducible outputs" (Morrison and Cleary 2008:774)
"Hence, essentially all tests use sufficient energy to achieve breakage in a single impact to improve the reproducibility of the test." (Morrison and Cleary 2008:774)
"The currently accepted evidence for apparent impact breakage in AG and SAG mills is the presence of freshly broken particles in the mill charge - as well as the expected rounded ones. However, as shown in Fig. 3, there are essentially no suitable impacts available to break even quite small particles in a single hit" (Morrison and Cleary 2008:774)
"This suggests that there exists a threshold energy for particle interactions above which cracks begin to propagate within the core of the particle - even though the particles may still appear to be completely intact" (Morrison and Cleary 2008:774)
"This leads to a useful definition of "body breakage". This term includes both impact and incremental breakage." (Morrison and Cleary 2008:774)
"The effect of repeated small impacts has now been investigated in some detail (Morrison et al., 2007). A satisfactory model for the probability of breakage, degree of breakage and likely progeny size distribution was developed based on the standard JKMRC impact breakage model (Napier-Munn et al., 1996) and the work of Vogel and Peukert (2004) with modifications suggested by Shi and Kojovic (2006)." (Morrison and Cleary 2008:774)
"The frictional and rounding modes of breakage produces well rounded pebbles which apparently suffer very little internal damage" (Morrison and Cleary 2008:774)
"Figs. 6 and 7 show the fractions of survivors after 1-10 hits at 20\%, 30\%, 40\% and 50\% of the specific energy required to cause breakage in a single impact. These figures provide a useful way of describing incremental impact breakage" (Morrison and Cleary 2008:775)
"By its nature, incremental breakage also has the interesting feature that very few particles are likely to be severely broken when they do finally fail." (Morrison and Cleary 2008:776)
"Fig. 11 shows the size distributions of progeny produced by incremental breakage compared with progeny from single impacts" (Morrison and Cleary 2008:776)
"The coarse progeny produced in this way will be rapidly rounded in the mill and may be the underlying cause of the so called "critical size" problem common to AG and SAG mills." (Morrison and Cleary 2008:777)
"A combined rounding, chipping and abrasion breakage model has been embedded within the CMIS DEM Code and used to simulate the 1.2 m diameter pilot mill" (Morrison and Cleary 2008:778)
"Many of the key processes in wet grinding mills are controlled by the flow of slurry within the mill and out of it" (Morrison and Cleary 2008:779)
"Mill power draw can be predicted with high precision" (Morrison and Cleary 2008:780)
"Particle rounding can be considered in terms of DEM interactions between particles with realistic shapes." (Morrison and Cleary 2008:780)
"Mass loss of rounded particles is proportional to the DEM estimates of frictional energy loss between the particles." (Morrison and Cleary 2008:780)
"Typically, particles larger than 20-30 mm are not broken by single impacts but acquire internal damage by many impacts whose magnitude is greater than an ore dependant, specific threshold energy." (Morrison and Cleary 2008:780)
"The required specific energy depends on degree of smoothing of the particle by the action of the mill charge." (Morrison and Cleary 2008:780)
"Contrary to some historical views, the mill charge does not behave like a partially filled tank of slurry. The mill volume fills with slurry from the outer edge and a slurry pool forms only when the charge is completely full." (Morrison and Cleary 2008:780)},

The pebbles crusher is often oversized, and thus not fully utilized. The hypothesis put forward in this paper is that active control of the cone crusher's eccentric speed and closed side setting (CSS) can increase throughput and/or energy efficiency of the SAG circuit. To verify this hypothesis, a dynamic model of a SAG mill-pebble crusher circuit was implemented. The dynamic unit models are based on results presented by several different researchers, whose results here have been combined and implemented in Matlab/Simulink. Previous research shows that by controlling the cone crusher operational parameters, the product particle size distribution (PSD) can be altered during operation. However, few papers have been published about whether the changes of the pebbles crusher's product PSD, lead to a higher performance of the SAG circuit. This paper examines the relations between the SAG mill and the pebble crusher in closed circuit while putting emphasis on controlling the pebble crusher in order to optimize the circuit throughput.},

	abstract = {A flexible and powerful dynamic simulation approach to grinding circuit simulation has recently been developed in CSIRO Minerals. The MATLAB/SIMULINK graphical programming environment has been used to construct a library of dynamic mathematical models of a number of key grinding and separation devices and to link them into various complex dynamic grinding circuits. True real-time dynamic simulation and visualisation of interlinked unit process operations in grinding circuits of arbitrary complexity can readily be achieved. The application of the dynamic simulation approach can help greatly in understanding the sometimes complex, nonlinear behaviour and dynamic interactions in various grinding circuits. Dynamic simulation can be used to test "what-ifs" in grinding process operations such as circuit response to variations in feed and unit operation characteristics. It is a cheap and effective means of investigating circuit optimisation without the risk of possible damage to operating units or production of a large amount of unwanted product during a physical optimisation process. Dynamic simulation is also extremely useful in developing and testing new ideas for process soft-sensors and control. The experience and knowledge gained in dynamic simulation of grinding circuits is directly applicable to other dynamic flowsheet modelling and optimisation problems in the minerals and process engineering industries. The advantages of building flowsheet models within the MATLAB/SIMULINK programming environment include the ability to readily develop and modify continuous, discrete and/or hybrid models of individual unit operations, with solution of the flowsheet system by a powerful in-built suite of equation solvers and analysis of results utilising extensive existing graphical capabilities. Flowsheet models of arbitrary complexity can easily be graphically developed, while individual unit models can be developed in terms of graphical block diagrams and/or customised block models written in computer code. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

"Detecting the onset of overloading in a semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill is a challenging task for operators to perform due to the complex and nonlinear nature of an overload" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:960)

In this paper, we compare the suitability of LLE to detect the early onset of an overload against kernel PCA and support vector machines" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:960)
"The primary objective for a SAG mill is to maximize the throughput of fresh ore. Fresh feed rate, however, is constrained by the total volume occupied by the charge inside the mill Norma" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:960)
"If the charge volume c Overload exceeds a certain threshold, the mill begins to overload and ent communition) (inefficient communition and grinding efficiency decreases in a positive feedback may damage equipment) mechanism" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:960)
"The physics of an overload are complex" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:960)
"Fig. 1 illustrates the three possible mechanisms of an overload. The first mechanism is the volumetric overload: a volumetric overload occurs when the charge volume is too high and is caused by overfeeding the mill for the particular steel charge volume and dynamic feed characteristics such as the particle size, hardness, and composition" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:960)
"As accumulation occurs, volume occupied by the charge increases such that the total distance ore can fall under gravity, known as cataracting, decreases" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:960)
"Once a SAG mill has begun to overload, ore will rapidly accumulate until the charge level reaches the center of the mill and slurry spills out of the feed and discharge chutes" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:960)
"Additionally, any disturbance that causes the grinding efficiency in the mill to decrease may also lead to volumetric overloading due to the accumulation of charge in the mill" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:960)
"Depending on the charge density, the bearing pressures may not climb high enough to raise an alarm. Therefore, operators find it difficult to detect volumetric overloading early since this type of overloading is a function of the unknown volume rather than the known mass of the charge" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:961)
"One possible solution is to observe the shift in the center of gravity of the mill. Load distribution may be measured using the pressure readings from the bearing pads supporting the mill. However, the distribution of the charge in the mill is often subtle in the early stages of an overload and also unique for each different overload mechanism" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:961)
"Slurry pooling occurs when an excess of slurry accumulates inside the mill and results in the formation of a slurry pool at the toe of the charge where cataracting ore impacts. The pool acts as a strong damper to the charge's impact energy; as a consequence, grinding efficiency is hampered" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:961)
"The slurry physically fills up the interstitial spaces in the solid charge as the material is lifted up with the rotation of the mill. When all the interstitial space is occupied by slurry, a pool forms at the toe of the charge. The resulting reduction in grinding efficiency may lead to the mill overloading if corrective action to the feed is not taken" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:961)
"To detect this mechanism of overloading, operators rely on observing the deterioration of the positive correlation between bearing pressure and motor power" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:961)
"However, mill power does not have a consistently repeatable behaviour during the onset of this phenomenon due to the unique shift in the mill's center of gravity from both slurry pool formation and subsequent charge accumulation. Consequently, the characteristic inverse correlation between power and bearing pressure of an overload only becomes obvious to operators once the mill is severely overloaded from slurry pooling" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:961)
"The third and final overload mechanism is freewheeling. This occurs when charge becomes trapped between the lifter bars due to the combined effects of centripetal force and the viscosity and density of the charge (Dean, 1999). The inertia of the trapped charge combines with the kinetic energy of the mill and effectively reduces the motor load" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:961)
"As a consequence of reduced grinding efficiency from reduced lifting capacity, the charge becomes static and ore accumulates. This eventually leads to volumetric overloading if corrective action is not taken to increase the feed water or decrease the ore feed rate in order to decrease the density and viscosity of the charge" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:961)
"Ko \& Shang (2011) proposed using principal component analysis (PCA) as a linear process monitoring technique to detect the onset of an overload. Due to its limitations as a linear method, their study does not identify which abnormalities are overload events" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:961)
"To overcome the drawbacks of PCA, we compare three nonlinear process monitoring techniques for overload detection in this paper: Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)" (McClure and Gopaluni 2015:961)},

	abstract = {Uncertainty analysis of an industrial grinding optimization process involving various sources of uncertainties and multiple numbers of objective functions has been studied in this work. Two primary sources of uncertainties, e.g. (1) operational parameters such as feed size distributions that are subjected to uncertainty due to varied range of feed sources that the industrial grinding process handles, and (2) model parameters that are obtained by the regression analysis of experimental data and subjected to regression and experimental errors, have been considered. Moreover, obtaining statistical distributions for these uncertain parameters are practically challenging. Hence, these parameters are considered as fuzzy numbers and the embedded uncertain multi-objective optimization problem has been analyzed using credibility based fuzzy robust optimization (FRO) technique. This technique helps in converting the uncertain fuzzy optimization formulation into a deterministic equivalent form, which can be further utilized to obtain the Pareto solutions by well-developed evolutionary algorithms. Initially, PO solutions are obtained by considering the uncertainty in different sets of uncertain parameters separately. This is followed by the study of amalgamated effect of uncertain parameters on PO solutions. Along with this, different fuzzy measures e.g. credibility, possibility, necessity etc. are utilized to observe their effects on final solutions. PO solutions obtained from possibility and necessity based FRO show the optimistic and pessimistic attitudes of risk, respectively. This provides a key to a decision maker to select any point based on the existing risk appetite. As compared to the deterministic results, the robust Pareto solutions show potential improvements of 26\% and 16\% in throughput and mid-size fractions, respectively. This generic approach not only provides the solution for robust range of operation based on the risk appetite of the enterprise, but also helps a decision maker to decide which parameters, amidst the set of uncertain parameters, are more sensitive to the results utilizing various fuzzy measures such as credibility, possibility and necessity. Along with this, the PO solutions obtained with robust optimization are compared with the solutions obtained by Expected Value Model (EVM).},

	abstract = {AngloGold Ashanti Metallurgy has recently been involved in the successful installation of intelligent, expert control systems on the milling circuits. The benefits of expert systems in these highly interactive circuits are obvious. Existing comminution tools, which have been developed and can now be incorporated into online control, include improved modelling techniques and understanding, robust and competent simulation methods, sampling techniques, and optimization methods. The minerals processing industry has seen the benefits of predominantly research-based centres turning their focus to commercial applications of comminution circuit modelling packages, which in turn can be utilized within expert control systems. Expert mill control has been successfully installed at AngloGold Ashanti South Africa{\textquoteright}s Mponeng and Kopanang Gold Plants. Expert control has also been installed at AngloGold Ashanti{\textquoteright}s West African Sadiola Mine operation. The implementation of the systems has produced a number of positive outcomes. Plant surveys usually result in the identification of sub-optimal areas, and the control philosophy is then configured to ensure that these areas (along with the entire circuit) are optimized and maintained. Outdated PID loops have generally resulted in oscillatory control with large amplitude deviations from set-point. Significant improvements in SAR Metallurgy operations have been realized, firstly through achieving stability in the load and cyclone control, and secondly through online identification and implementation of optimized set-point conditions for mill mass, discharge density, etc. Soft sensors are configured to accurately estimate parameters that were historically not measurable, viz. breakage rate, mill load condition, online kWh/t-75 microns, mill discharge density and cyclone overflow grading. The Mponeng Plant system achieved circuit stability and improved overall grind. The Plant was able to pay back the control installation after 3 months, based on the additional recovery obtained from the finer grind. The system at Kopanang Plant has also resulted in enhanced plant recovery as a result of a finer grind and a lower residue gold content. The payback for this system was calculated at approximately 6 months. AngloGold Ashanti Metallurgy is currently expanding the installation of expert control to its other operations. It is also evaluating the performance of various suppliers of advanced control systems.},

	abstract = {The recently developed reference-command tracking version of model predictive static programming (MPSP) is successfully applied to a single-stage closed grinding mill circuit. MPSP is an innovative optimal control technique that combines the philosophies of model predictive control (MPC) and approximate dynamic programming. The performance of the proposed MPSP control technique, which can be viewed as a 'new paradigm' under the nonlinear MPC philosophy, is compared to the performance of a standard nonlinear MPC technique applied to the same plant for the same conditions. Results show that the MPSP control technique is more than capable of tracking the desired set-point in the presence of model-plant mismatch, disturbances and measurement noise. The performance of MPSP and nonlinear MPC compare very well, with definite advantages offered by MPSP. The computational speed of MPSP is increased through a sequence of innovations such as the conversion of the dynamic optimization problem to a low-dimensional static optimization problem, the recursive computation of sensitivity matrices and using a closed form expression to update the control. To alleviate the burden on the optimization procedure in standard MPC, the control horizon is normally restricted. However, in the MPSP technique the control horizon is extended to the prediction horizon with a minor increase in the computational time. Furthermore, the MPSP technique generally takes only a couple of iterations to converge, even when input constraints are applied. Therefore, MPSP can be regarded as a potential candidate for online applications of the nonlinear MPC philosophy to real-world industrial process plants.},

	abstract = {Systems optimization is an exciting new tool for improving the performance of existing comminution plants while incurring minimal capital expenditures and producing high rates of return. The goal of this approach is to achieve significant performance gains without installing new equipment or replacing older, less efficient equipment. Thus, rates of return can be much higher than the historical rates of return in the process industries. This paper describes a methodology for systems optimization that has produced significant rates of return for several comminution plants. The approach seeks to determine important cost-sensitive, synergistic interactions in a plant, find the optimum conditions that improve the performance of the whole plant and accurately identify the tradeoffs between incremental costs and additional revenue. The interactions are described by mathematical models of the processes occurring in the system which can then be programmed into plant simulators. Two case studies of comminution plant optimization which illustrate the concepts of systems optimization are presented in this paper. The first case study concerns a system optimization project for the SAG mill circuit at a western US gold mine. The financial rate of return for that project was 145\%. The second case study is a systems optimization project with a rate of return of 115\% for a large iron ore concentrator in Europe.},

"The most recent expansion involved the installation of a low aspect ratio SAG mill to replace the secondary crusher. Without operational data on the low aspect mill, combined with a site team that was new to SAG milling, there were many challenges in achieving the target throughput from the circuit" (Felsher et al 2015:54)
"In ball mills, grinding media accounts for approximately 80\% of the total mass of the mill charge and dominates both power draw and grinding performance. In SAG mills, however, the feed ore is used as a significant portion of grinding media. Therefore, a change in feed size distribution or hardness can result in a noticeable difference in breakage characteristics, which impacts the charge level and mill power draw" (Felsher et al 2015:56)
"Another challenge encountered while transitioning from ball-milling to SAG milling was that the heuristics for SAG and ball mill operations are the opposite. Power draw can be used to detect mill load in both SAG and ball mills. When a ball mill starts to load up, the power draw gradually decreases. In SAG mills, this trend is reversed. Typically, as a SAG mill loads-up, the power draw increases" (Felsher et al 2015:56)
"However, if a SAG mill is severely overloaded, its center of gravity shifts and the mill power draw starts decreasing. This is referred to as a 'classical overload' or 'freewheeling'. A 'freewheeling' mill can be identified when the hydrostatic bearing pressure is increasing (due to increased holdup of material), but the power draw is decreasing" (Felsher et al 2015:56)
"Figure 3 and Figure 4 show real-life examples of the Bell Creek SAG mill being ground-out following mill overloads" (Felsher et al 2015:57)
"In Figure 3, both bearing pressure and mill power can be seen to be increasing up until the mill feed is stopped. As the mill is ground-out, both bearing pressure and power draw decreases" (Felsher et al 2015:57)
"This relationship is inversed in Figure 4 , where the bearing pressure is increasing while the mill power draw decreases due to the onset of a classical overload. In the case of Figure 4, as the mill is ground-out, the bearing pressure drops significantly, however the power draw increases (this is a typical response for a SAG mill coming out of a classical overload)" (Felsher et al 2015:57)
"These examples highlight a fundamental difference between ball mill and SAG mill control. While monitoring power draw alone is sufficient for ball mills, in SAG mills, both bearing pressure and power draw need to be considered for proper operation and control" (Felsher et al 2015:57)},

	abstract = {Grade Engineering{\textregistered} comprises a range of techniques aiming to reject low grade uneconomic material (preconcentration) as early as possible within the mining value chain. It has been identified as an effective and feasible operating strategy whereby mining unit metal productivity can be significantly increased. Two Grade Engineering (G.E) levers have been assessed in a copper porphyry deposit: preferential grade by size response, and differential blasting for grade. Those are exploited through a modified blasting fragmentation coupled with screening based process on run-of-mine material to recover upgraded undersize fractions. Application of G.E inevitably alters comminution circuit typical feed particle size distributions, and consequently impact semi-autogenous (SAG) milling performance. A factorial design approach has been employed to assess the extent of this effect. A wide range of different operating scenarios, representing the possible G.E strategies and dynamic processing rock attributes, were simultaneously assessed using the Integrated Extraction Simulator (IES), a new cloud-based process simulator. This enabled the development of a G.E throughput improvement model as function of blasting fragmentation, impact hardness (Axb) and grindability (BMWi), which can be employed to conduct more detailed process modelling as well as resource optimisation. Improvements up to 14\% in throughput due to changes in mill feed particle size distributions were observed under the conditions examined. The impact of this effect upon the proportion of material that is amenable to G.E is also discussed.},

	abstract = {There is an increasing demand to optimize performance and profit of comminution circuits. Research in this area has resulted in the development of numerous optimization tools, and recent research has shown that the quality aspects of the production have a great influence on the optimization results. The quality, cost, profit and capacity of a product are influenced by several parameters, and in order to control all of these parameters it is necessary to use some sort of optimization algorithm. In this paper, a novel approach to apply e.g. cost, revenue, capacity and quality in order to perform a multi objective optimization with the ability to handle dynamic variations of a comminution is presented. The problem with optimizations in general is that the objective function used for optimization is reduced in complexity in order to save computational time. In a comminution process performance varies with time and in order to perform a correct optimization the objective function used must be able to handle this type of dynamic behavior. The process has a given set of constraints that represents the conditions normal in these type of comminution applications. The first step in this paper is to identify if the range of the constraints can cause undesirable production costs when reaching for a given product property. In this step a dynamic response model is described that will be able to address the difficulties with optimizing dynamic systems. The next step in the optimization is the definition of the multi-objective optimization formulation including constraints for the optimization. Evaluating the result of the optimization in combination with a strategy for relaxing constraint can show how to increase overall productivity and still reach certain product properties. The conclusions made in this work are that multi objective optimization is essential when optimizing a comminution circuit against multiple objectives.},

These dynamics can originate upstream and be inherent through the process or occur anywhere in the downstream process. Traditional plant simulations are performed with steady-state simulation, which are limited to give the performance in an ideal situation. However, plant performance usually tends to deviate away from the predicted plant performance. These dynamics are usually consequences of an altered state of the plant due to factors such as natural variation, unmatched, inappropriate or degrading equipment performance and/or stochastic events. This paper presents a novel approach for simulating dynamic plant behavior and evaluating effects from process modification through dynamic simulations with MATLAB/Simulink. An example of an existing crushing circuit is used to illustrate the functionality and the advantage of using a dynamic simulator.

	abstract = {This dissertation covers research carried out over the past 20 years in the area of knowledge engineering in mineral processing, specifically with regard to process data as a form of knowledge. This focus on data-driven plant automation includes the acquisition, interpretation and application of data in the development of decision support systems in mineral processing, as well as the development of data analytical methodologies required to accomplish this. The following subthemes have been covered: o Inferential sensors - predominantly the development of computer vision systems for froth flotation and the analysis of particulate systems, but also acoustic sensors and the interpretation of electrochemical noise. My research into inferential sensors has centred on the development of methodologies and algorithms to interpret image data and not the development of hardware, such as camera systems or other types of sensing devices. A major part of this pioneering research has focused on the interpretation of froth flotation images. Instead of attempting to identify individual objects (bubbles) in these images, we have treated the froth images as statistical patterns. These patterns could be interpreted by suitable feature extraction algorithms and models that could relate these features to meaningful process indicators. The novelty and impact of my research in this area can be inferred not only from the corpus of highly cited papers that associated with the technology, but also from the commercialization of the technology. o Exploratory data analysis - Focusing on unsupervised learning, such as applied in data visualization, cluster analysis and feature extraction. In exploratory data analysis, the main issue is attempting to make sense of many measurements of large sets of variables. Standard multivariate statistical methods have their limitations when dealing with complex data, and a significant part of my research has concentrated on the extension of linear methods to their nonlinear variants by use of neural networks or other machine learning approaches. Work in this area has formed the basis of a sizeable number of industrial workshops and has significantly influenced the development of commercial process systems software. o Data-based process modelling - Machine learning approaches to predictive and diagnostic modelling. The construction of process models plays a key role in process systems engineering. This is the case in advanced control systems, where the ability to predict future process states is critical. Models also play an important role in the interpretation of process data and hence the acquisition of insight into process behaviour and mechanisms. Such models can be developed from first principles, but this is costly and with the abundance of process data, often not necessary. The primary impact of this research has been in the development and application of methods to predict process states or key performance indicators for mineral processing systems. o Process monitoring and fault diagnosis - Multivariate statistical process control from a machine learning perspective. Process monitoring and fault diagnosis has evolved into a key element of process control over the last couple of decades, and is currently experiencing strong growth, with commercial application still lagging significantly behind the advances in academia. My research in this area has centred on the application of neural networks, kernel-based systems, random forests and other machine learning methods to extend current approaches. It has led to the foundation of the Anglo American Platinum Centre for Process Monitoring at Stellenbosch University and the development of algorithms that were adopted by industry on a proprietary basis. o Intelligent decision support and advanced control - Fuzzy decision support systems and neurocontrol based on the use of reinforcement learning. Apart from data that are generated by instruments, tacit knowledge in the form of plant operator experience and theoretical knowledge is also a valuable resource that can be used in the automation of plant operations. This is the domain of knowledge-based or expert systems and research was undertaken in the development and application of these systems in mineral processing. The novelty of this research has mainly been in the proof-of-concept studies published in academic journals and conference proceedings. It goes without saying that in my research, I have been assisted by many colleagues, industrial collaborators, students and assistants. The contributions of these co-workers were often critical to the investigations indicated in this thesis and are indicated as such, hopefully without omission, where appropriate.},

	abstract = {This work aims to build a generic dynamic model structure, which can accommodate interchangeable sub- models of each sub-process, making it amenable to continuous upgrade without the need for redevelopment, for multicomponent tumbling grinding mills. The Generic Tumbling Mill Model Structure (GTMMS) is based on a population mass balance framework which incorporates breakage characteristics, transport, classification along the mill, a discharge function, and energy consumption incorporated in a dynamic mill model structure. Version III builds on two earlier versions by incorporating energy distributions derived from discrete element modelling, an updated version of the 4D breakage appearance function which applies to a broader size range, and addresses multi-component ore breakage via the probability distribution of energy split based on material stiffness. Themodel has been tested against multi-component plant survey data. GTMMS III suggests a mechanis- tic insight into mixture prediction through component analysis and is a step forward towards the unified commi- nution model (UCM) with its mechanistic, generic, and dynamic prediction capability. {\textcopyright}},

	abstract = {Optimisation of grinding circuits is invariably dependent on sound process models together with process simulators that can solve the process models accurately. Most of the process models are solved numerically because analytical solutions are not available, which can lead to errors in the results due to the numerical approximation of mathematical equations. Whiten [1], and Valery Jnr \& Morrell [2,3] have developed a dynamic model with numerical simulation for autogenous and semi-autogenous mills, and validated the model with dynamic response of mills in terms of power draw, grinding charge level, slurry level and product size distribution to changes in feed rate, feed size, feed hardness and water addition [2,3]. In this work, an analytical solution for their dynamic model of tumbling mills has been developed based on the knowledge of solutions to the first-order nonhomogeneous linear differential equations. Two algorithms, Direct Single Time method (DST) and Direct Multiple Time method (DMT), were applied to obtain the analytical solutions respectively. It was found that analytical solutions are more accurate than the traditional finite difference numerical methods. However, the DST analytical method has a drawback of numerical instability due to the accumulation of round-off errors which are amplified by exponential functions, whilst the DMT method can provide stable solutions. To test the DMT analytical method, two cases of SAG mill dynamic operation were studied with both the traditional numerical method and the newly developed analytical method, further proving the robustness and feasibility of the analytical solutions.},

	abstract = {This survey report provides most of information on recent developments of models for modern mills, simulators and on-line control systems for comminution circuit optimisation in Australia. Recent model development for modern mills mainly focus on the simulation in the high pressure roller mills (HPRM) and the horizontal and vertical stirred media mills. For the HPRM modelling, the normal and semi-empirical models for power draw, product size distribution and throughput have been validated. These models have been used for the scale- up purposes. In the simulation of the experimental results obtained in the stirred media mills (including tower mills), the population balance method with tracer technology has been used. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method and the discrete element method have been also utilised to predict the performance of the stirred mills. The steady-state process simulation for comminution circuit optimisation can be simulated by a software named JKSimMet. This simulator combined with JKSimBlast/ has been applied to analyse and optimise the comminution chain from mine-to-mill in order to reduce energy consumption without decreasing the throughput and operating efficiency. The USIM PAC package also offers a design criteria for comminution process optimisation in Australian mineral processing industry. On-line analysis and control systems for elemental analysis, moisture, particle size and geometry have been developed for effective control and optimisation of a processing flowsheet on streams (especially in comminution processes), in Australia. In addition, acoustic emission soft-sensors have been applied for control and optimisation of a mill performance.},

	abstract = {The aim of any comminution circuit is to produce material of a desired particle size distribution (PSD) at a minimum operational cost. Currently, the comminution process is energy intensive and operates at very low efficiency when the input energy is compared to the breakage achieved. The attainable region (AR) technique has been successfully used to solve optimization problems simultaneously with the process synthesis formulation of reactor systems. The AR looks at the fundamental processes of a given system and determines all the possible outputs to which the objective function can be applied and an optimal process solution selected. Particle breakage, separation (classification) and mixing are identified as the three fundamental processes of interest taking place during comminution. Breakage and mixing processes are used in this paper to illustrate the applicability of the AR theory in comminution. We develop a fundamentally based model which is equipment independent to describe breakage. Specific energy is the independent variable and the production of particles with a certain PSD is the objective function. We use geometric construction to represent this PSD as a point in an n-dimensional space in relation to an input specific energy. Output PSDs are dependent on the input PSDs, allowing connectivity of the batch grinding stages to form a pseudo-continuous process. Specific energy is used as the control variable to obtain sharper product PSDs. It is shown that the same net energy consumed in the system can produce different product PSDs. Therefore, this implies that the design of comminution circuits should achieve better control of the specific energy. Once the candidate AR is constructed, operational process targets can be defined more accurately. This establishment of targets permits a measure of the actual process efficiency against a theoretical target. The advantage of the AR method lies in its ability to develop not only the performance of the optimal circuit but also the operational conditions to be used in the optimal process circuit. This also answers the process synthesis question of the type of equipment to be used which is a function of the specific energy. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Over the last few years, a number of vision or optical systems became commercially available to determine particle size distributions of ore or other material on a conveyor belt, or in some cases at the discharge of a truck or even in a pile in some cases. Most such systems were designed as standalone measurement devices, which generate information for the operators or for an independent control system. The VisioRock system is innovative both from the hardware and software point of view. It is based on the USB technology - although it can use either analog or industrial USB cameras - and the software is integrated within the vision module of the OCS{\textcopyright} advanced control software. It is possible to install VisioRock cameras at many different locations in a comminution circuit, which interact with the control system and help to increase plant performance. The paper describes the VisioRock technology and some of the possibilities which result from its integration with OCS{\textcopyright}. For instance, in addition to measuring the particle size distribution of solids, VisioRock can determine texture and color separately for each size class, discriminate between ore types and size distribution for different type of particles, and ability to seamlessly combine image analysis algorithms with other artificial intelligence tools such as expert systems, fuzzy logic, neural networks or phenomenological process models. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This series of papers present 20 applications of the model for the mineral and coal industries. Part 3 of this series reviews its application to modelling comminution equipment. It is demonstrated that the JK size-dependent breakage model not only can be used for modelling particle breakage, but also can be employed as a basic structure for modelling comminution equipment. This is different to the traditional equipment modelling approaches, in which the population balance models are dominant. In this energy-size reduction modelling approach, the JK size-dependent breakage model provides a key mathematical template to rationally link the size reduction as the equipment model output with ore breakage property and specific energy as the two model inputs. Five case studies are reviewed, which includes modelling of a hammer mill for coke feed preparation, a vertical spindle mill for coal pulverised fuel grinding, a ball mill for batch grinding and continuous operation, HPGR simulations based on piston press testing data, and high voltage pulse disintegration of ores. A common feature of these models is that they all incorporate the measured material breakage characteristic parameters and machine operational conditions that are represented by the size-specific energy relation. The energy-size reduction modelling approach permits the simulations of the effects of changes in ore/coal and machine operating conditions on comminution product size distribution.},

The model uses five states: rocks, solids, fines, water and steel balls. Rocks are defined as too large to be discharged from the mill, whereas solids, defined as particles small enough to leave the mill, consist of out-of-specification coarse ore and in-specification fine ore fractions.

"Modelling and simulation of autogenous (AG) and semi-autogenous (SAG) mills are valuable tools for helping to design the best circuit for a given application and subsequently to optimise its performance" (Morrell 2004:437)

"circuit and the ease with which combinations of circuit designs can be evaluated on a throughput, power draw and product size basis. Added advantages of the simulation route are its versatility, its ability to simulate the entire comminution" (Morrell 2004:437)
"Perhaps its most important advantage over the more traditional power-based techniques is its ability to interface with blast fragmentation models so as to assess and optimise the impact of blast design and ROM feed size distribution." (Morrell 2004:437)
"Practical experience has shown that feed size variation can be significant and this can have a major impact on AG and SAG mill circuit performance." (Morrell 2004:437)
"The successful application of modelling and simulation in design and optimisation rests heavily on having a model which is lifelike" (Morrell 2004:437)

"In an attempt to address this problem a new AG/SAG mill model has been developed which incorporates the capability to respond to changes in most design and operational variables and which has been validated using a wide range of industrial data." (Morrell 2004:438)
"In grinding mills the energy that the rotation of the mill shell imparts to the grinding media is subsequently transferred to ore particles with which they are in contact, so causing breakage" (Morrell 2004:438)
"The process is a discrete one, as it comprises many individual collisions or breakage "events". The products of these breakage events may then leave the mill via the discharge grates and pulp lifters due to entrainment by slurry, or remain to undergo further breakage." (Morrell 2004:438)
"The specific energy associated with particle breakage is related to the energy of the grinding media and the mass of the target rocks, whilst the frequency of these events is associated with the number of grinding media and the rate at which they circulate within the mill" (Morrell 2004:438)
"for modelling purposes it is necessary to have a description of at least the following: {\textbullet} frequency of breakage events for each size fraction; {\textbullet} energy associated with each breakage event; {\textbullet} size distribution of the products from each breakage event; {\textbullet} transport of slurry through the grates/pulp lifter." (Morrell 2004:438)
"The most useful framework for encapsulating the size reduction process in a grinding mill is one based on the so-called population balance model (Epstein, 1947), the Whiten variant of this approach (1974) being the most valuable for AG/SAG mill modelling." (Morrell 2004:438)
"To model the discharge function advantage was taken of the two distinct regions illustrated in Fig. 1. The region with a constant discharge rate reflects the purely fluid characteristics of the discharge stream" (Morrell 2004:439)
"The breakage distribution function is the progeny size distribution that results from breakage of the parent rock." (Morrell 2004:440)
"This distribution will vary depending on the rock strength and the energy with which it is broken" (Morrell 2004:440)
"The JKMRC's approach is ideal for this purpose. This uses a two-parameter description of rock breakage that is obtained from a drop-weight test (Napier-Munn et al., 1996)." (Morrell 2004:440)
"A The two parameters ( b) t and are ore specific and relate the (a size distri- 10 E bution index) to the applied specific energy ( cs)." (Morrell 2004:440)
"t Higher impact energies produce higher values of 10, which are reflected in products with finer size distributions." (Morrell 2004:440)
"Eq. (9) provides the means to predict the product size distribution but it requires the specific energy used for t breakage before it can predict the 10." (Morrell 2004:440)
"Leung assumed that, although a wide range of energies are experienced by rocks in a mill, on average it should be linearly related to the mill diameter." (Morrell 2004:440)
"He therefore developed an algorithm that estimated the mean grinding media size and calculated its kinetic energy on impact when dropped from a height equal to the mill diameter." (Morrell 2004:440)
"From equation (1) it can be seen that, providing the feed and product flowrates and size distributions, the mill rock charge mass and size distribution, as well as the breakage distribution function are measured, the breakage rate distribution can be back-calculated" (Morrell 2004:440)
"It is convenient to represent distributions such as that given in Fig. 3 using cubic splines (Ahlberg et al., 1967)." (Morrell 2004:440)
"Although the general shape shown in Fig. 3 appears to be maintained for a wide range of conditions it varies in a systematic manner with factors such as ball load (Morrell and Morrison, 1996) and total charge volume (Morrell et al., 2001)." (Morrell 2004:440)
"there is a major problem with determining what the exact variation is, which is related to the difficulty in obtaining load size distributions." (Morrell 2004:440)
"without a load size distribution the breakage rate cannot be calculated directly" (Morrell 2004:440)
"The data used to construct Fig. 3 were obtained from an audit of a 7 m SAG mill whose entire rock, slurry and ball load of 150 tonnes was removed, separated and sized (Morrell, 1989)." (Morrell 2004:440)
"it is possible using data fitting techniques to estimate the breakage rate distribution without a load size distribution" (Morrell 2004:440)
"The feed, product and breakage distribution function must still be known, but in this case a non-linear fitting routine is used to simultaneously estimate both the breakage rate and load size distribution" (Morrell 2004:440)
"This can be done by choosing the load size and breakage rate distribution that best predicts the observed product size distribution. The criterion of minimising the sum of the squared deviations between the observed and predicted sizings of the product stream is normally used for this purpose" (Morrell 2004:440)
"The problem with this approach is that there is often a range of solutions that give very similar results in terms of the goodness of fit" (Morrell 2004:440)
"Together they define an envelope, within which the true distribution is expected to fall. The magnitude of envelopes such as these makes the experimental determination of trends in the breakage rate distribution difficult to define with precision." (Morrell 2004:441)
"The reason for attributing the differences to the rate of rotation (rpm) is that the energy calculation algorithm should have accounted for the influence of mill diameter via its relationship to breakage energy." (Morrell 2004:441)
"The size reduction part of the model predicts what the mass of rock and the quantity of slurry will be in the mill for a given feed rate. The power model uses this information to predict what the volume, density and position of the charge will be. The position of the grinding media portion of the charge is described using the conceptual view shown in Fig. 10" (Morrell 2004:441)
"The toe of the slurry portion of the charge is therefore not necessarily coincident with that of the grinding media." (Morrell 2004:442)
"This situation occurs in all overflow discharge ball mills and gives rise to the lower power draw which is usually seen in overflow ball mills compared to grate discharge units with the same size, ball charge and speed" (Morrell 2004:442)
"It also causes the drop in power seen in AG/SAG mills that are fed at a rate that is too high for the grate/pulp lifters to handle" (Morrell 2004:442)
"effectively extends beyond the grinding media toe. If the flowrate is high enough a slurry pool forms (Fig. 11d) in which case the slurry toe" (Morrell 2004:442)
"To test the validity of the model data from 21 different full-scale AG/SAG mill circuits were used" (Morrell 2004:444)
"The simulations were run by first inputting the design and operational conditions as well as the JK rock A b. breakage parameters, and" (Morrell 2004:444)
"A new AG/SAG mill model has been developed which incorporates some of the tried and proven elements of a number of previous models as well introducing a number of recent developments, particularly in the field of slurry transport." (Morrell 2004:445)
"The model should find application as a stand-alone design tool, to scale-up from pilot data and to optimise existing circuits." (Morrell 2004:445)},

	abstract = {Mineral processing productivity relates to a range of operating parameters, including production rate, product grind size, and energy efficiency. Variations in ore properties and operating conditions change the comminution dynamics, resulting in a constant deviation from operational goals. Although most processing facilities currently use fixed speed grinding mills, variable speed drive is considered to provide an important control variable that can contribute to achieving operational objectives.   This thesis examines variable speed ball mill performance under changing operating conditions to recommend operating conditions for the Copper Mountain Mine. JK SimMet, a very powerful predictive tool, was used to estimate grinding circuit performance and mill power consumption. Samples and operating data were collected directly from the Copper Mountain Mine to build a calibrated model. Appearance (breakage distribution) functions of different geo-samples were measured and used to predict plant performance under different ore property variations.  The results indicate that higher mill speed and lower ball load operating strategies are preferable with respect to energy savings in variable speed ball mill operations. Ore characteristic variations at the Copper Mountain Mine are significant and can cause large oscillations within mill operations. Thus, ore blending in Copper Mountain should be done carefully and cautiously. However, in combination with traditional optimization methods, ball mill grinding speed can be used to control energy input and offset the influences of ore variability. Optimum ball mill operating conditions can be determined based on circuit design and operating dynamics for any given run-of-mine ore.  iv  Lay Summary Grinding is an important process in the mining industry that is used to break ore to a targeted size. Grinding conditions are not constant during production, and can be affected by changes in ore types and operating conditions. As drive technology develops, variable speed drives are gradually being accepted into the mining industry and are now considered an important mill speed control that can contribute to maintaining a steady product size.   In this thesis, adequate variable speed ball mill operation strategies are developed based on JK SimMet simulation results. The results indicate that variable speed drives can be used effectively as a means of controlling energy input to offset the influences of ore variability with improved comminution energy efficiency.},

	abstract = {A non-linear observer model of a semi-autogenous grinding mill is developed. The observer model distinguishes between the volumetric hold-up of water, solids, and the grinding media in the mill. Solids refer to all ore small enough to discharge through the end-discharge grate, and grinding media refers to the rocks and steel balls. The rocks are all ore too large to discharge from the mill. The observer model uses the accumulation rate of solids and the mill{\textquoteright}s discharge rate as parameters. It is shown that with mill discharge flow-rate, discharge density, and volumetric hold-up measurements, the model states and parameters are linearly observable. Although instrumentation at the mill discharge is not yet included in industrial circuits because of space restrictions, this study motivates the benefits to be gained from including such instrumentation. An extended Kalman filter is applied in simulation to estimate the model states and parameters from data generated by a semi-autogenous mill simulation model from literature. Results indicate that if sufficiently accurate measurements are available, especially at the discharge of the mill, it is possible to reliably estimate grinding media, solids and water hold-ups within the mill.

"mineral processing industry in particular has yet to take full advantage of model-based advanced process control" (le Roux et al 2017:27)

However, the algebraic fitting procedure is too sensitive to uncertainties in measurements as the procedure involves the calculation of first and second order time-derivatives from noisy data" (le Roux et al 2017:28)
"The model of Coetzee et al. [29 ] is used by Olivier et al. [30] to estimate the mill inventories and grinding environment parameters in simulation. Assuming measurements of the mill discharge are available, a dual particle filter is used to estimate the hold-up of balls, rocks, solids, fines, and water as states, and the fraction of rock entering the circuit and the power needed per tonne of fines produced as parameters" (le Roux et al 2017:28)
"Since the grinding performance of a mill depends on the hold-up of steel balls, ore, and water, control of these three hold-ups can reduce the variance in the throughput and quality of the mill's product" (le Roux et al 2017:28)
"this work aims at developing an observer for use in model-based control strategies of grinding mill circuits such that the hold-ups in the mill can be regulated" (le Roux et al 2017:28)
"distinguishes between the volumetric hold-up of water, solids, rocks, and balls in a SAG mill" (le Roux et al 2017:28)
"from an observability analysis, the states and parameters of this model are locally (weakly) observable, but they are not observable from the linearised observer model." (le Roux et al 2017:28)
"The measurements used by the reduced observer model are the total volumetric filling, the mill discharge flow-rate, the mill discharge density, and the derivative of the mill discharge density" (le Roux et al 2017:28)
"Although instrumentation at the mill discharge is not yet included in industrial circuits because of space restrictions, this work motivates the benefits to be gained from including such instrumentation" (le Roux et al 2017:28)
"To illustrate the effectiveness of the observer, a simulation study using an EKF is presented" (le Roux et al 2017:28)
"Results indicate that the modelled states can be reliably estimated if sufficiently accurate measurements are available." (le Roux et al 2017:28)
"Slurry pool conditions should be avoided as they decrease the mill power draw and the breakage rate by cushioning material falling from the charge shoulder to the charge toe." (le Roux et al 2017:29)
"The combined mass of the mill and of the charge inside the mill is generally measured using either load cells or bearing pressure. Because this is not a direct measurement of JT , the relation between JT and a mass measurement needs to be determined whenever a mill survey is performed" (le Roux et al 2017:30)
"The calibration exercise should be repeated at reasonable intervals as the loss of liner mass through wear and tear will cause a drift in the accuracy of the relationship. Once the drift in the data is quantified, an empirical liner wear model can be constructed to predict the service life of liners and adjust the relationship between the mass measurement and JT over time" (le Roux et al 2017:30)
"Because of space restrictions at the discharge trommel of the mill, inclusion of flow and density instrumentation at the mill discharge is not yet a viable reality" (le Roux et al 2017:30)
"In the case where the mill discharges into a sump, !Q and Q can be back-calculated from a flow-balance if all other inflows and outflows are measured, but this is sensitive to the accuracy of measurements at the sump" (le Roux et al 2017:30)
"Although JB is not measured directly, it can be approximated inferentially using models and measurements of Pmill or JT" (le Roux et al 2017:30)
"Generally a linear relationship between the rock volume and ball abrasion rate is assumed. This assumption allows for the calculation of MFB to maintain an approximately constant JB in terms of the tonne of ore milled" (le Roux et al 2017:30)
"The aim of the observer is to use the variables listed in Table 1 as measured quantities to estimate the mill states, the discharge rate constant, and the ore and ball breakage rates." (le Roux et al 2017:30)
"The constituents in the mill are modelled as four volumetric quantities: water (xw ), solids (xs ), rocks (xr ), and balls (xb )" (le Roux et al 2017:30)
"The cumulative breakage rate function is defined as the rate per unit mass that a given species coarser than a given size breaks to below that size [37 ]. This is an advantage over other population balance models which require two functions, a breakage rate and an appearance function, to describe grinding kinetics" (le Roux et al 2017:31)
"A disadvantage of this approach is that the cumulative rate of breakage of ore above a given size si is assumed to be unaffected by the grinding environment and the detailed structure of the size distribution above si" (le Roux et al 2017:31)
"Empirical relationships are required to relate the parameters of the cumulative breakage rate function to variations in the milling environment" (le Roux et al 2017:31)
"more sophisticated models face similar problems where the parameters of both the breakage rate and breakage distribution function vary according to changes in the grinding environment" (le Roux et al 2017:31)
"the consumption of rocks (RC) and balls (BC) in the population balance of (2b) to (2d) are described as RC = xr Kr (3a) BC = xb Kb ," (le Roux et al 2017:31)
"The mill discharge model for the observer is adapted from the model presented in Morrell and Stephenson [44], where the discharge of charge from the mill through the end-discharge grate is viewed as a product of two mechanisms: the fluid transport through the grate, and the solids classification by the grate which differentiates between ground particles either returning to the milling chamber for further grinding or becoming part of the mill discharge stream." (le Roux et al 2017:31)
"Therefore, the discharge of the water (Vwo ) and solids (Vso ) in (2a) and (2b) can be expressed as Vwo= "(xw+ xs )xw (10a) Vso= "(xw+ xs )xs ." (le Roux et al 2017:32)
"For this study, it is assumed that measurements of JT , Q and !Q are available" (le Roux et al 2017:32)
"kP is a lumped power draw parameter to account for heat losses due to internal friction, energy for attrition and abrasion breakage and rotation of grinding media, plus inaccuracies associated with the assumptions and measurements of the charge shape and motion" (le Roux et al 2017:32)
"PC as an empirical function of JT and the mill charge density (!C )" (le Roux et al 2017:32)
"Ideally !C could be inferred from the measurement of Pmill using the power draw model in Apelt et al. [36 ]. However, to use the model, parameter kP in (12) must be fitted to process data. This fitting process requires !C to be known. Therefore, the observer model does not make use of Pmill as an output equation as it only introduces additional parameters to estimate." (le Roux et al 2017:32)
"the dimension of the observability codistribution dO was determined using Maple.1 The dimension of dO at a generic point x0 is 7 , which implies that the non-linear system is locally (weakly) observable" (le Roux et al 2017:33)
"A longer time horizon for the MHE reduces the validity of modelling the parameters as constants, but a shorter time horizon may not include sufficient system dynamics for the observer to estimate the unknown states and parameters" (le Roux et al 2017:33)
"From an analysis of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix A it can be seen that the three unknown parameters (", Kr , Kb ) each contribute an integral mode to the linearised system" (le Roux et al 2017:33)
"Because of this repeated mode, two of the three parameters need to be chosen in the linearised model for the other parameter to be linearly observable" (le Roux et al 2017:33)
"To achieve linear observability, the model in (16 ) is reduced based on the assumption that the dynamics of the slurry (xw and xs ) is much faster than the dynamics of the grinding media (xr and xb )" (le Roux et al 2017:34)
"The observability matrix O of the pair (C, A) has full column rank. Therefore, all states and parameters are observable" (le Roux et al 2017:34)
"The SAG mill simulation model of Le Roux et al. [28] was developed with the aim to produce reasonably accurate model responses using as few parameters and states as possible. The model was validated using industrial plant data" (le Roux et al 2017:35)
"The model divides the ore into the same two size classes as used in the observer model. Therefore, the mill inflow flow-rates are the same as in (1), and the population balance of the model is the same as in (2)." (le Roux et al 2017:35)
"There is no feedback controller for the mill. For the sake of experimentation, it is assumed the flow from the classifier to the mill remains constant throughout the simulation." (le Roux et al 2017:37)
"The plant is excited by sinusoidally varying input MIW with a period of TMIW = 12 min and an amplitude of 8 m3 /h around its initial condition" (le Roux et al 2017:37)
"Disturbances in the feed-ore size-distribution and the feed-ore hardness are simulated by varying ?r and )r around their nominal values." (le Roux et al 2017:37)
"The covariance matrix Rk for the EKF aligns with the covariance of the measurement noise added to the plant outputs." (le Roux et al 2017:37)
"For the second simulation scenario where noise is added, the noisy measurements are filtered using a Savitzky-Golay digital filter. The filter smooths data by fitting a frame of F data samples with polynomials of small order N by means of linear least squares" (le Roux et al 2017:37)
"To minimise this time delay, two consecutive filters are used." (le Roux et al 2017:38)
"Because ?! is calculated from the Q filtered data, another 6 8 samples delay is introduced. The equivalent delay is 86 samples, i.e. 17 2 s." (le Roux et al 2017:38)
"The states and parameters of a non-linear grinding mill observer model developed in this paper are weakly non-linearly observable, although they are not observable in the linearised case" (le Roux et al 2017:40)
"For linear observability, a reduced observer model was developed." (le Roux et al 2017:40)},

	abstract = {To assist in the study and understanding of plant dynamics, circuit interactions, mill operational behaviour and automatic control schemes, a model of the dynamic behaviour of autogenous (ag) and semi-autogenous mills (sag) is currently under development at the JKMRC. The model is being developed to provide an accurate dynamic response in terms of power draw, grinding charge level, slurry level and product size distribution for changes infeedrate, feed size, feed hardness and water addition. The conceptual structure of the model is described together with dynamic data from 2 full scale high aspect ratio autogenous mills which will be used to validate the model. The data were obtained from a series O.fstep tests and comprise trends in power draw, bearing pressure, solids and water flowrates as well as an indication of the fraction of coarse rocks in the feed. This latter quantity was obtained from a novel, yet simple device for counting rocks which will be described. The mills measured response to these step changes is presented together with an e{\textasciitilde}planationfor their behaviour in terms of the physical changes which took place inside the mill.},

"For effective AG/SAG mill operation and control, the measurement and control of important mill variable such as feed size, ore hardness and mill load are desired" (Valery and Morrell 1995:1285)
"The lack of available instrumentation to measure these variables is one factor which has impeded the development of more advanced and effective AG/SAG mill control" (Valery and Morrell 1995:1285)
"One solution to such a problem is a dynamic model that can be used to predict information about the process that cannot be easily measured" (Valery and Morrell 1995:1285)
"a conceptual model is described which is being developed to provide accurate dynami response in terms of power draw, rock and slurry levels as well as product size distributio" (Valery and Morrell 1995:1285)
"Wh i t e n ' s contents based mode" (Valery and Morrell 1995:1286)
"T h e model contains 3 parameters which must be determined before the equations 1 and 2 can be solved These are: the breakage rates (r i) which can be regarded as the breakage frequency and which vary with factors such as mill speed and charge size distribution [2]" (Valery and Morrell 1995:1287)
"t he appearance function (aij) which describes the size distribution of the products from breakag events and which is a function of the ore type and the specific breakage energy" (Valery and Morrell 1995:1287)
"t he discharge rate (di) which relates the load to the flowrate of products out of the mill." (Valery and Morrell 1995:1287)
"Sol ut i on of the grinding model equations 1 and 2 gives predictions of the product size distribution, charge size distribution and charge mass" (Valery and Morrell 1995:1290)
"Given the charge mass, mill dimensions and mill speed, the power draw can also be estimated" (Valery and Morrell 1995:1290)
"In practice the effect of a slurry pool is to reduce the power draw. This can manifest itself in closed circui mills as an observed association between the amount of recycle and the power draw, which drops as the recycle increases [711" (Valery and Morrell 1995:1291)
"Co n t r a r y to normal open circuit conditions where" (Valery and Morrell 1995:1292)
"t he power would nolrmally drop in response to a reduction in feedrate (Figure 9), in this case the power initially climbs as the slurry in the pool flows out of the mill." (Valery and Morrell 1995:1293)
"Ra p i d l y increasing water addition to a mill is often used by operators to quickly reduce the power draw when it threatens to exceed overload levels" (Valery and Morrell 1995:1293)
"I n this case the initial effec of the water surge is to flush accumulated finer solids out of the mill and hence the charge density and power draw decreased" (Valery and Morrell 1995:1293)
"I t is possible that if the water increase is large enough a slurry pool may also form and further assist with the drop in power. However as the finer solids are flushed out the grinding media voidage will increase,, allowing the slurry level to drop" (Valery and Morrell 1995:1293)
"F e e d size distribution changes are one of the most common causes of erratic behaviour in ag and sag mills" (Valery and Morrell 1995:1294)
"Th i s results from the grinding media being obtained from the feed" (Valery and Morrell 1995:1294)
"as the feed size distribution varies the load size distribution will also vary. The breakage rate distribution will then change and in turn cause a change in the load size distributio" (Valery and Morrell 1995:1294)
"Me a s u r e me n t of the dynamic response to changes in the feed size distribution are difficult to obtain, making the task of validation of the models response equally difficult. This is due to the problems of measuring feed size distributions on-line" (Valery and Morrell 1995:1294)
"An infrared sensor was installed on the feed belt with the beam being transmitted and reflected across the belt." (Valery and Morrell 1995:1294)
"Ea c h time the infra red beam was interrupted by coarse rocks, a digital signal was sent to the control system. The output of this "rock counter" was monitored and recorded as the number of rocks per minute larger than a certain size." (Valery and Morrell 1995:1294)
"t he p e b b l e stream is returned to the mill. The mine uses this facility in a novel manner to tightly control the mill power in a very narrow band" (Valery and Morrell 1995:1294)
"Th e action of the recycle crusher can therefore be viewed as causing a step change in the feed size distribution. The reason for the observed effect of the crusher has to do with the influence of the so-called critical size fraction in the mill." (Valery and Morrell 1995:1296)
"Thi s is typically in the 25-50mm size range. In many mills it will be found that this fraction constitutes a very large proportion of the mill load. It is therefore responsible for drawing a significant amount of power as well as occupying a large amount of mill volume. By extracting a large proportion of this material and reducing it to a size which can exit the circuit and/or is better able to be ground by the mill, reductions in mill load and power can be achieved" (Valery and Morrell 1995:1296)
"T h e structure of the model is such that it should provide realistic responses to changes in feedrate, water addition, recycle load, feed size distribution and ore hardnes" (Valery and Morrell 1995:1296)},

"Individual particle impact histories of contact angle, force, and impulse are required to realistically model breakage" (Powell and McBride 2006:1013)
"It is argued that the majority of breakage results from cumulative damage, thus it is essential to track individual particle histories to realistically predict the breakage product from a mill" (Powell and McBride 2006:1013)
"The discrete element method (DEM) has been adopted by many researchers as a tool for simulating and understanding comminution devices, and in particular tumbling mills" (Powell and McBride 2006:1013)
"Simulations of mills can provide information on individual particle position and contact force history" (Powell and McBride 2006:1013)
"The outputs can thus allow some predictive capability of how the energy spectra will vary with changes in milling conditions." (Powell and McBride 2006:1013)
"The DEM produces large amounts of potentially useful information. For example, at every time step the particle's position, and translational and rotational velocities may be recorded" (Powell and McBride 2006:1013)
"If the particle is in contact with another particle or the mill shell, the magnitude of the normal and shear contact forces and energy absorbed in the interaction can be recorded" (Powell and McBride 2006:1013)
"Accepting the underlying limitations of the DEM, i.e., simplified particle geometry, and the inability to simulate ore breakage, the challenge is to interpret and utilise the particle data to improve the predictive capability of comminution models" (Powell and McBride 2006:1013)
"Particles do not necessarily break through single collision events, but may cumulate damage before breaking through a series of relatively low energy impact events." (Powell and McBride 2006:1014)
"The computational simulations need to represent the mechanical environment in sufficient detail and accuracy to provide an accurate prediction of the consequent damage or breakage of the ore." (Powell and McBride 2006:1014)
"The hypotheses and their outcomes will be referred to in establishing what outputs should be derived from DEM simulations in order to model breakage." (Powell and McBride 2006:1014)
"Several gross assumptions concerning the contact event are made in standard DEM simulations" (Powell and McBride 2006:1014)
"The first concerns the form of the contact model and the second relates to the use of standard material properties to describe an interaction event" (Powell and McBride 2006:1014)
"While not addressed in this work, the influence of particle shape on the charge motion and resulting contact forces may be significant and needs to be considered." (Powell and McBride 2006:1014)
"The nature of the problem being simulated cannot, however, be overlooked when considering the appropriateness of the contact model. The linear spring and dashpot model originally implemented in the seminal work of Cundall and Strack (1979) was intended to describe pseudo-static contact events common in soil mechanics applications. The appropriateness of this contact model to correctly describe the collision events within the dynamic environment of a comminution device is questionable and deserves further investigation." (Powell and McBride 2006:1014)
"Binning techniques provide a natural way to deal with a large amount of data. Particle history and contact event data can be averaged using one-dimensional bin or histogram plots" (Powell and McBride 2006:1016)
"An issue that remains to be addressed is how to deal with simultaneous multiple impact events on a single particle." (Powell and McBride 2006:1017)
"The currently most widely accepted technique for testing impact breakage is the JKMRC drop-weight test, NapierMunn et al. (1999). The impact energies have been chosen to ensure breakage in a single impact event" (Powell and McBride 2006:1018)
"It is well recognised that abrasion accounts for a considerable portion of the reduction of the ore in a mill" (Powell and McBride 2006:1019)
"However, to utilise the power of the outputs of DEM a more detailed description of the degree of abrasion for the range of shear energies found in the comminution device should be obtained." (Powell and McBride 2006:1019)
"It is proposed that a potential major contributor to rock damage and reduction is the chipping that occurs principally on fresh angular rocks, and spalling that occurs as a result of sub-critical impacts" (Powell and McBride 2006:1019)
"Improved breakage testing techniques are required to exploit the power of DEM simulations." (Powell and McBride 2006:1020)},

The slurry solids are allowed to settle and then the depth of solids is measured. All measurements are relative to ball level, not absolute slurry level, which for an overflow mill is a function of the discharge trunnion diameter" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1488)"If the solids are well below the ball level, with a watery layer above, then the mill is under-loaded with slurry. If there is a solid settled layer above the balls then the mills are overloaded" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1488)"For single stage SAG/AG mills the slurry level should be just below the charge level, to maximise fine grinding.

(Powell and Mainza 2006:1489)"When snapshot surveys are combined with the single-point sizing technique, 4-8 conditions can be established in one (often long) day, depending on the size and residence time of the mill, and unplanned changes in mill feed." (Powell and Mainza 2006:1489)"Almost all of a ball mills power draw is determined by the ball loading, with variation in the ore loading contributing only a few percent" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1489)"For general pilot work, as opposed to a specially calibrated and usually cantilevered mill with a high level of accuracy in torque measurement (Pietsch, 1972), the variation in power draw with ore loading in the mill is lost in the noise of the power measurement" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1489)"Austin et al. (1984) showed that both underloading and overloading of ore in the ball mills lead to low breakage rates which result in lower grinding efficiencies" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1489)"For an overflow ball mill the slurry level is consistent, but the solids loading in the slurry can vary widely" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1489)"when different milling conditions, such as ball size, mill filling, grinding media shape, discharge mechanism, slurry density, etc. are tested at a constant mill feedrate, the differences in mill performance can be almost completely absorbed by changes in mill voidage, when some of the conditions lead to under-filling of the mill" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1489)"it was found that there does not appear to be a reliable standard pilot milling technique that would address these issues." (Powell and Mainza 2006:1489)"To the surprise of the investigators it was found that the chosen feedrate was at the tail end of the mill performance" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1490)"At lower feedrates the scats have a considerably coarser grind which drops off and flattens right up to 850 kg/h, before dropping to its lowest value" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1490)"By chance the pilot trials had been conducted at the throughput where the two trends crossed over" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1490)"What is more, it can be deduced that the optimal operating point of the pilot mill is at 600 kg/h, just prior to the dropoff in fineness of grind" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1490)"a decision has to be made on what conditions to conduct trials at when investigating the performance of a SAG mill for the first time" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"Generally the input of the operator, plant records, and some short term step tests to check the response of the mill can be used to help determine the most favourable test conditions" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"Often the standard operating conditions are opted for by default. This strategy can be useful for setting up a base case model of the mill, but when testing the influence of changing some particular variable, for example feed type or size distribution, the results can be as misleading as the example of inappropriate ball mill pilot tests" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"It can also be the case that mill operators run a mill at a particular filling, speed, percent solids, etc. more by default than design" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"Many a site has hung tenaciously onto an historically established good operating regime, despite major changes to ore, liner design, ball load etc., resulting in the mill operating well off its peak performance potential." (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"This is often an issue to be addressed in consulting optimisation work." (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"For a SAG mill there are many variables against which a grindcurve can be developed. The ones that can be most readily varied, and are common control parameters, are mill speed, mill filling, and percent solids" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"As the ideal percent solids can generally be established up front (as described earlier), and many mills have a fixed speed, the mill filling is the most common parameter to vary in developing a grindcurve" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"A critical part of developing a filling grindcurve is establishing the relationship between percent filling of the mill and an external load measurement, such as load cells, bearing back pressure, or power when the other two are lacking" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"It is essential that the filling is accurately known, and this can only be assessed through entering the mill to physically measure the filling" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"The authors record for a standard four point measurement (to provide a reliable average along the mill) from mill stop to restart is 12 min, including lockout and safe entry procedures" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"A key to this is using a laser tape measure, a rugged Hilti surveyors unit, accurate to 1 mm and with a 100 m range is used by the authors. This enables accurate and rapid height and diameter measurements in any size mill" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"A critical parameter in the load filling relationship, and in modelling a mills performance, is the ball load, and this should be established through grindout" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"The filling data at the end of the grindout provides an excellent extreme point in the filling-load curve, and helps to give an accurate curve fit" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"For a grindcurve covering 5-6 conditions, 2 crash stops and the grindout to measure ball filling are sufficient to establish the filling calibration" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"Convenient tests during the snapshot are chosen for the crash stop calibrations. For the remainder of the snapshot tests the filling is calculated from the calibration curve. Accuracies of 0.3\% filling can be attained." (Powell and Mainza 2006:1491)"It has been found that the gradual adjustment of feedrate in small steps is the most rapid path to a new filling and feedrate" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1492)"An example of an excellent grindcurve that was established as part of the P9N AMIRA test work conducted at the AngloGold Ashanti Kopanang site," (Powell and Mainza 2006:1492)"The grindcurves show how the power, throughput, and circuit product vary with mill filling." (Powell and Mainza 2006:1492)"The resultant grindcurves were used to establish the ideal conditions for the research test work. In addition the grindcurve is a production tool, which can be used to select the optimal target operating conditions" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1492)"It is also operationally more stable to remain T ( o \% M" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1492)"below the power peak, rather than seeking back and forth over the peak and drifting into periods of poor operation. A combination of power seeking and the desired mill load can be used to control the mill."

(Powell and Mainza 2006:1493)"The resultant curves are also of direct use in establishing optimal control objectives of the mills, in seeking the balance between throughput and product size, or just seeking maximum throughput" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1493)"With periodic tests used to establish the grindcurves as the ore type changes, and for variations in major operating parameters such as ball filling, a family of grindcurves can be established to provide outstanding control objectives, and checks on the circuit performance." (Powell and Mainza 2006:1493)"Single-point sizing This gives the percent retained on a single screen size by using only a Marcy cup and scale or a measuring cylinder and balance, and the chosen screen" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1493)"This takes only a few minutes, yet it has been found that when properly applied the results are within 1\% of the fully screened sample. This technique is excellent for quick feedback when trying to stabilise a pilot or production circuit, or check the stability of a grinding circuit, or quickly developing a grindcurve" (Powell and Mainza 2006:1493)},

	abstract = {A semi-autogenous (SAG) or autogenous mills (AG) circuit commonly comprises a pebble (cone) crusher to deal with the critical size particles. The pebbles crusher is often oversized, and thus not fully utilized. The hypothesis put forward in this paper is that active control of the cone crusher{\textquoteright}s eccentric speed and closed side setting (CSS) can increase throughput and/or energy efficiency of the SAG circuit. To verify this hypothesis, a dynamic model of a SAG mill-pebble crusher circuit was implemented. The dynamic unit models are based on results presented by several different researchers, whose results here have been combined and implemented in Matlab/Simulink. Previous research shows that by controlling the cone crusher operational parameters, the product particle size distribution (PSD) can be altered during operation. However, few papers have been published about whether the changes of the pebbles crusher{\textquoteright}s product PSD, lead to a higher performance of the SAG circuit. This paper examines the relations between the SAG mill and the pebble crusher in closed circuit while putting emphasis on controlling the pebble crusher in order to optimize the circuit throughput.},

Although it has been over a quarter of a century since this tool was first used to predict media motion it has not yet reached maturity to be used in predicting product size distribution and throughput of tumbling mills" (Tavares 2017:106)
"The operation of a ball mill is a capitaland energy-intensive process, so that even marginal improvements in their efficiency result in immense benefits to the industry" (Tavares 2017:106)
"These so-called energy-size reduction relationships were originally only used as one-size descriptors of comminution (Bond, 1952), but with the advent of the size-mass balance, or population balance model (Herbst and Fuerstenau, 1980), improvements from this type of relationships also became useful to describe the change of the entire size distribution from the feed to the product." (Tavares 2017:106)
"great value can be gained by using distributed information on specific comminution energies, rather than averages" (Tavares 2017:107)
"discrete element method (DEM), which conveniently allows predicting the distribution of collision energies in a mill" (Tavares 2017:107)
"DEM makes it possible to predict how collisions vary in magnitude and frequency as the geometry, the ball charge and the mill speed are varied" (Tavares 2017:107)
"The present work focuses primarily on the research dedicated to predict particle breakage in ball mills, analyzing in particular DEM-based approaches to predict size reduction in mills, called here "advanced models"." (Tavares 2017:107)
"The first attempts in coupling impact energy information to particle breakage data to predict grinding have been made in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These were used to predict the functions that make up the traditional population balance model" (Tavares 2017:107)
"the breakage function Bij commonly used in the traditional population balance model could be interpreted as the weighed-average of the energy-dependent breakage distribution function values" (Tavares 2017:107)
"This is certainly a more logical and intuitive approach than assuming a constant breakage distribution function, as used in the traditional PBM formulation of ball milling" (Tavares 2017:107)
"These approaches, however, had the serious limitation of requiring impact energy data, which was very difficult to estimate experimentally" (Tavares 2017:107)
"DEM provides a numerical procedure for solving Newton's second law with an appropriate contact relationship that can be applied to describe the motion of each grinding medium contained in the mill charge to predict element position, velocity and forces of interaction over time" (Tavares 2017:107)
"The relevance of the method when applied to milling lies in its ability to account for" (Tavares 2017:107)
"The technique is now packaged in a number of commercial as well as open source software, being able to describe media motion in three dimensions, which is critical to provide the quantitative information required for mill simulation" (Tavares 2017:108)
"In DEM, particles are either considered undeformable (hard) or deformable (soft)" (Tavares 2017:108)
"Algorithms that allow describing particle breakage inside the DEM environment are more recent developments" (Tavares 2017:108)
"Unfortunately, this intuitive approach is not yet feasible to be used in any realistic way to simulate industrial ball mills, since breakage algorithms add to the already high computational demand for simulating these mills and also can lead to an "explosion" on the number of particles in the simulations, making computation unfeasible at this time." (Tavares 2017:108)
"particles are much finer in size than the grinding media, leading to difficulty in keeping track of the immense number of particles contained in full-scale mills, besides the need to reduce the time step to avoid overlapping the media with the smallest powder particles" (Tavares 2017:108)
"Lu{\'i}s Marcelo Tavares / KONA Powder and Particle Journal No. 34 (2017) 106-124 the effects of a number of variables explicitly, including mill speed, mill filling, ball size distribution and liner configuration. 108" (Tavares 2017:108)
"One pragmatic solution to this in the case of ball mills is to simplify the problem by not including the ore or powder particles in DEM, only the grinding media in the simulations," (Tavares 2017:109)
"The key advantage of this approach is that the milling environment can be decoupled from the ore or powder in size reduction" (Tavares 2017:109)
"In spite of the increase in computing power, modeling ball mills is still better described considering only the grinding charge and not the powder in the DEM simulations, relaying on post-processing the data using a proper population balance formulation to predict grinding" (Tavares 2017:120)},

	abstract = {Several important, fundamental aspects of the grinding behaviour of mineral systems are addressed. The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for systems of constrained non-linear equations was used to solve the steady-state and dynamic population balance model (PBM) grinding equations to obtain the mill matrices and grinding selection and breakage rate functions, respectively. The fact that the PBM model equation Inverse Problem is degenerate or underspecified is demonstrated. Multiple solutions to the same PBM equations are provided. It is shown that there is no unique solution to the Inverse Problem unless additional constraints are provided or assumptions are made 'such as the Arbiter-Bhrany nonnalisation assumption. The severity of the non-uniqueness problem for steady state grinding is demonstrated in several examples using typical feed distributions and mill matrices. In addition, it is also demonstrated that when higher than single powers are used in steady-state mill matrix expressions during simulation or calculation (or iterative procedures are used during numerical simulation) and four or more size intervals are used considerable amount of error is propagated throughout any calculation. Each solution to a PBM, while giving the same prediction during a single mill pass, gives different solutions or predictions for mill composition upon subsequent passes. In addition, it is shown that there is a problem with building up a grinding mill knowledge base with PBMs. A similar analysis was done for the dynamic or kinetic PBM equations. The fact that the dynamic PBM Problem is degenerate or underspecified is also demonstrated. Multiple solutions to the same dynamic PBM equations are provided. Again, it is shown that there is no unique solution to the Inverse Problem unless additional constraints are provided or assumptions are made such as the nonnalisation assumption. Each solution to a dynamic PBM, while giving the same prediction for a given grinding time interval, gives different solutions or predictions for mill composition for other grinding times. Actual experimental grinding data was assessed to determine the functionality of mill selection and breakage functions. The functionalities obtained through constraints were compared with those obtained with the nonnalisation assumption of Arbiter-Bhrany which relates breakage functions to particle size distribution. The capability of the population balance model to predict grinding behavior over time in various mineral grinding systems was assessed. 1he required functionality of selection and breakage functions for effective prediction of grinding behavior in mineral systems is discussed.},

Stable feeding regimen to the mill, enhanced throughout, energy saving and human operator training are the most important objectives of this advanced control system. The fuzzy system calculates optimum set points for plant distributed control loops, causing them to tune semi-autogenous grinding mill performance to new operating set points. Although leading companies have their own commercial control packages, this supervisory controller is coded in MATLAB{\textregistered} and is able to connect to plant lower level controller. The controller has been tested and verified in Sungun copper concentrator semi-autogenous grinding circuit. Results proved the ability of proposed supervisory control system to increase the throughput of the mill by 3.26\% and decrease the specific energy consumption by 6.29\% at the same time. On the other hand, smooth set points calculated by the fuzzy control system, decrease the fluctuations in mill operation which finally results in a more stable operation of the grinding circuit.},

	abstract = {Non-linear population balance models (PBMs), which have been recently introduced due to the limitations of the classical linear time-invariant (LTINV) model, account for multi-particle interactions and thus are capable of predicting many types of complex non-first order breakage kinetics during size reduction operations. No attempt has been made in the literature to estimate the non-linear model parameters by fitting the model to experimental data and to discriminate various models based on statistical analysis. In this study, a fully numerical back-calculation method was developed in the Matlab environment to determine the model parameters of the non-linear PBM. Not only does the back-calculation method identify the parameters of complicated non-linear PBMs, but also it gives the goodness of fit and certainty of the parameters. The performance of the back-calculation method was first assessed on computer-generated batch milling data with and without random error. The back-calculation method was then applied to experimental batch milling data exhibiting non-first order effects using both the LTINV model and two separate non-linear models. The back-calculation method was able to correctly determine the model parameters of relatively small sets of batch milling data with random errors. Applied to experimental batch milling data, the back-calculation method with a two-parameter non-linear model yielded parameters with reasonable certainty and accurately predicted the slowing-down phenomenon during dry batch milling. This study encourages experimenters to use advanced non-linear population balance models along with the back-calculation method toward estimating the breakage rate and distribution parameters from dense batch milling data sets.},

"No attempt has been made in the literature to estimate the non-linear model parameters byfitting the model to experimental data and to discriminate various models based on statistical analysis" (Capece et al 2011:195)
"The so-called direct " measurement method" demands tedious breakage experiments on numerous mono-sized feeds to determine the parameters" (Capece et al 2011:195)
"Back-calculation, a technique which calculates the model parameters that bestfit the model to the experimental data, is also widely employed and has significant advantages over the direct measurements." (Capece et al 2011:196)
"Despite the varying success of the above methods and application of the LTINV model, non-random deviation between experimental milling data and modeled predictions of Eq. (1) were noticed and became a source of some criticism" (Capece et al 2011:196)
"Austin and Bagga [4] investigated such deviation and observed that the specific rate of breakage decreased asfines accumulated and determined that the source of non-first order effects originated from a cushioning action provided byfine particles" (Capece et al 2011:196)
"They subsequently assumed that the specific rates of breakage for all particle sizes varied in the same way as the milling environment changed according to an accelerationdeceleration function" (Capece et al 2011:196)
"It has also been shown in many milling studies [4,30,33,34] that non-first order kinetics is significantly contributed by multi-particle interactions. In other words, the breakage of a particle is affected by the surrounding population" (Capece et al 2011:196)
"Due to the ability of this non-linear population balance model to encompass many different types of particle breakage kinetics phenomenologically, we argue that it can lead to better design, control, and optimization of size reduction processes" (Capece et al 2011:196)
"Because no analytical solution exists for the non-linear model, calculation of the breakage rate parameters, breakage distribution parameters, and the non-linear functional parameters remains a formidable challenge." (Capece et al 2011:196)
"While the non-linear model has exceptional modeling and predictive benefits, it appears that no attempt has been made to estimate the non-linear model parameters byfitting the model to experimental data." (Capece et al 2011:197)
"This study addresses the inverse problem of identifying the parameters of non-linear PBMs using batch milling data while elucidating non-first-order effects due to multi-particle interactions and discriminates various models based on statistical analysis" (Capece et al 2011:197)
"A fully numerical back-calculation method was developed that uses a nonlinear optimization technique in conjunction with a fast and accurate ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver for the solution of the non-linear PBM." (Capece et al 2011:197)
"this is thefirst time an advanced back-calculation method was applied to non-linear PBMs." (Capece et al 2011:197)
"This back-calculation method was performed on computer-generated batch milling data without random error to show the accuracy of the methods and techniques used" (Capece et al 2011:197)
"In this manner, the model parameters determined by the back-calculation method may be compared to the model parameters chosen to produce the computer-generated data." (Capece et al 2011:197)
"Computer-generated data was produced by numerical solution of Eq. (6) presented below" (Capece et al 2011:197)
"The solution of Eq. (6) yields the mass fraction distribution from which the cumulative mass fraction undersize distribution was calculated so as to compare the model predictions and the experimental data" (Capece et al 2011:197)
"The number of size classes N was selected to be 160." (Capece et al 2011:197)
"Each size class was represented by its upper edge size, xi, that progresses from x1= 1000$\mu$m downward with a geometric progression ratio s of 21/16." (Capece et al 2011:197)
"A Gaussian feed (initial particle size distribution) with a mean size of 600$\mu$m and a standard deviation of 100$\mu$m" (Capece et al 2011:197)
"The alternative method to identify the model parameters is through back-calculation method utilizing non-linear optimization." (Capece et al 2011:198)
"The sum of squared residuals between the model predictions and the experimental data is minimized by a nonlinear optimizer and the best set of parameters is chosen" (Capece et al 2011:198)
"the non-linear optimizer fmincon", part of the " Matlab v7.9 optimization toolbox, was used to minimize the calculated error between the model and the experimental data." (Capece et al 2011:198)
"This optimization technique also requires, during each iteration, the discretized PBM of Eq. (6) to be solved numerically using the ODE integrator" (Capece et al 2011:198)
"All parameters except for two,$\varphi$ and$\lambda$, were constrained between 0.01 and 15.0" (Capece et al 2011:198)
"The parameter,$\varphi$, was constrained between 0.01 and 1.00 due to the form of the breakage distribution function chosen. The parameter$\lambda$, which is a scaling factor for the non-first order effects, was constrained between 25.0 and 25.0 to allow for the prediction of either deceleration or acceleration of the breakage rate" (Capece et al 2011:198)
"Due to non-linear structure of the objective function, comparatively large number of parameters tofit with the non-linear model, and possibly poor initial parameter guess, convergence may be excessively slow or may not be achieved. In order to circumvent this problem, the LTINV model, which has 5 parameters due to the forms of ki and bij chosen, wasfit to the experimental datafirst" (Capece et al 2011:198)
"In order to compare models based on the goodness offit, the sum of squared residuals SSR was calculated using Eq. (10)." (Capece et al 2011:198)},

	abstract = {A number of grinding mill dynamic simulators have been developed in the last half-century. However, complete circuit simulations are mainly limited to academic investigations, and on-site applications for advanced control or real-time optimization are scarce. One particular issue that has certainly curbed a more widespread use is the time and efforts required for model calibration. This paper illustrates this challenge and presents a calibration method based on dynamic simulation using industrial data and laboratory testwork. The simulator models discussed originate from the work of Austin and Luckie (1972) for grinding mills, and Plitt (1976) for hydrocyclones. A two-stage approach based on a least squares minimization allows determining calibration parameters values. Firstly, laboratory testwork are required for characterizing breakage coefficients of the ore. Secondly, step change responses and their simulation {\textendash} effect of ore and water feed rates on output flow rates and size distributions {\textendash} allows identifying transport/mixing conditions. Simulation results are in agreement with actual process responses to variations of feed conditions obtained from a plant survey.},

"Semi-Autogenous Grinding mills can be optimized for maximum ore throughput or maximum grinding energy efficiency" (Gough 2015:2)
"In both cases, precise control of the mill weight is critical" (Gough 2015:2)
"Model predictive control provides an additional tool to improve the control of Semi-Autogenous Grinding mills and is often able to reduce process variability beyond the best performance that can be obtained with proportionalintegral-derivative or expert system control methods" (Gough 2015:2)
"Mineral processing operations present many challenges for automatic process control due to variations in unmeasured ore properties, material transport delays, and nonlinear response characteristics" (Gough 2015:2)
"Maintaining the SAG mill weight at the optimum value is critical for achieving maximum grind rate efficiency and mill production (Powell, M.S., van der Westhuizen, A.P., \& Mainza, A.N. 2009)" (Gough 2015:2)
"SAG mill weight is difficult to control as the dynamic response changes as the mill approaches maximum capacity. Near maximum capacity, the weight response exhibits integrating behavior, and the mill can overload quickly" (Gough 2015:2)
"This situation is complicated by the transport delays in the feed system, so it is important that the control system can detect the imminent overload and adjust the feed rate quickly to prevent an overload" (Gough 2015:2)
"Expert systems are a popular approach to manage the control of these difficult processes in the mining industry" (Gough 2015:2)
"For SAG mill control, expert systems are often used as they are able to detect the rapid increase in mill weight and anticipate an imminent overload using combinations of rules" (Gough 2015:2)
"However they often reduce the feed rate more than necessary in some situations, and require time to return the feed rate to maximum levels, which decreases production capacity" (Gough 2015:2)
"Developing the expert system rules to manage the dynamic response of a process is not a simple task. The rules must manage error from the target as well as the rate of change of the process" (Gough 2015:2)
"If measured disturbance variables such as pebble recycle, ore feed size distribution or mill rotation speed are also included in the control design, then the expert rules become even more complex" (Gough 2015:2)
"Adjusting these rules to obtain optimal control response under all situations is difficult because there is no theoretical basis for determining these settings. This leads to a trial and error approach with uncertain dynamic control performance results" (Gough 2015:2)
"MPC is often able to reduce process variability beyond the best performance that could be obtained with PID or expert system control methods" (Gough 2015:3)
"MPC is able to manage applications where there are delays in the process response to actuator changes or multiple interactions between process variables" (Gough 2015:3)
"In particular, MPC is able to optimize the control of processes that exhibit an integrating type response in combination with transport delays or variable interaction" (Gough 2015:3)
"This type of response is particularly difficult to control, and it is common in mineral processing for many different processes including level control of flotation cells and crushers, and SAG mill weight control" (Gough 2015:3)
"Unlike the rulebased control approach of expert systems, MPC performance can be predicted and optimized in a systematic manner that ensures the dynamic control results are as expected" (Gough 2015:3)
"MPC has been successfully applied to SAG mill control at several copper mines in South America" (Gough 2015:3)
"MPC consistently demonstrated the ability to provide reduced process variability and increased stability compared to PID or expert system based control" (Gough 2015:3)
"Obtaining a process response model is a key part of the implementation of an MPC controller" (Gough 2015:3)
"In our design, the controller models the system response using a generic function series approximation technique based on Laguerre polynomials" (Gough 2015:3)
"This approach provides a simple and efficient method to mathematically model the process response with a minimum of a priori information" (Gough 2015:3)
"enables the controller to perform online adaptation of the process response models automatically, which is not possible when using models based on a simple open loop time series" (Gough 2015:3)
"The adaptive capabilities assist the control technician with developing the process response models, and the default configuration of the control parameters ensures excellent control performance once the process model is obtained" (Gough 2015:3)
"These factors reduce the implementation effort and contribute to quick installation times" (Gough 2015:3)
"Using these models as the basis for a predictive control design, the MPC is able to control processes with long delay or response times" (Gough 2015:3)
"This technique can also be used to automatically model and counteract the effects of measured disturbances by incorporating them into the control strategy as feed forward variables" (Gough 2015:3)
"The use of feed forward variables is particularly important for long time delay systems so that disturbances can be cancelled much sooner than is possible using feedback control alone" (Gough 2015:3)
"(Zervos \& Dumont, 1988). They proposed the use of a state-space model derived from Laguerre orthogonal basis functions so that process response model identification and adaptive control could be achieved without the need to know the process order or the time delay in advance" (Gough 2015:3)
"This method is efficient due to the similarity of the basis functions in the series to the signal being modeled, and also due to the special mathematical property of the basis functions called orthogonality that ensures a unique solution of the basis function weighting coefficients in the identified model" (Gough 2015:3)
"In process control, the process transfer functions are transient in nature and are not periodic, so Cosine functions are not an appropriate choice as a basis for the model structure. However, the elegance of the Fourier series technique provides many advantages such as simple and efficient model structure and excellent parameter convergence when estimating the model from observed data sets due to the orthogonality property of the Fourier series. The motivation of this research was to find an equally simple and efficient method to model the transient responses common in process control applications." (Gough 2015:4)
"The Laguerre functions are well suited to modeling the types of transient signals found in process control because they have similar behavior to the processes being modeled and are also an orthogonal function set" (Gough 2015:4)
"In addition, the Laguerre functions are able to efficiently model the dead time in the process response compared to other suitable function sets" (Gough 2015:4)
"After the process response model is obtained, a predictive control design is used to calculate the actual output actions of the controller" (Gough 2015:4)
"This concept of predictive control involves the repeated optimization of a performance objective over a finite horizon extending from a future time (N1) up to a prediction horizon (N2)" (Gough 2015:4)
"For applications of the MPC that involve just a single control output, a deterministic control law can also be obtained using a simple d-steps ahead process response prediction with a single step control horizon. In this case, the complexity of the design is greatly simplified and the control output can be calculated directly without the use of a search-based optimizer or a least squares calculation" (Gough 2015:5)},

	abstract = {The grinding process in ball mills is notoriously known to be highly inefficient: only 1 to 2\% of the inputted electrical energy serves for creating new surfaces. There is therefore obvious room for improvement, even considering that the dominant impact mechanism in tumbling mills is a fundamental liability limiting the efficiency. Moreover, the Coalition for Energy Efficient Comminution estimates that on average, 53\% of the energy consumed on a mine site is for comminution processes. This represents a tremendous leverage to generate economical and environmental benefits. This paper analyses how properly designed control systems allow a better usage of the capacity of grinding circuits, and a reduction of the specific energy consumption even without modifying the product size target. Three different control systems are compared: (1) typical basic regulatory, (2) regulatory control of the product size attribute, and (3) model-based predictive control. Simulation results show that controlling the product size distribution attribute ensures not only meeting downstream requirements and avoiding overgrinding, but also allows processing higher throughput in some instances, hence decreasing the specific energy. The discussion highlights the pros and cons of all three scenarios.},

	abstract = {As minerals frequently appear in complex associations in nature, liberation is one of the most relevant aspects in ore processing, and is achieved through comminution, which certainly is one of the most important but also expensive operations in industry. The global efficiency of the plant often depends on the performance of the grinding circuit, so there is a compromise between particle size, energy consumption and liberation. An adequate prediction of the liberation of grinding products can be helpful in reducing overgrinding, and therefore, reducing energy consumption without disturbing downstream operations. This paper addresses the development and validation of a mineral liberation model which is intended to be integrated in a simulation framework for comminution processes. Mineral species contained in the ore are distributed into size and liberation classes. Firstly, the size-by-size mineralogical distribution is related to the size distribution of the ore by means of a polynomial model. The next stage is to sort the mass of every species in every size class into liberation classes by means of a beta distribution function, whose characteristic constants are parameterised according to the ore properties. Results show great potential of the model to represent commonly observed industrial data, which provides opportunities for process simulation, optimisation and, to a lesser extent at this point, process control.},

	abstract = {Autogenous (AG) milling is utilised around the world for particle size reduction. The system exhibits highly non-linear behaviour in addition to being subject to unmeasured variability associated with most ore bodies. Anglo American Platinum aimed at improving online optimisation of the circuit by implementing industrial model predictive control (MPC) to reduce system variability and continuously drive towards the optimal operating point within system constraints. The industrial dynamic matrix controller commissioned on the AG mill with a variable speed drive resulted in a 66\% reduction in power and a 40\% reduction in load standard deviation. These are the main controlled variables of the mill. The controller also improved the objective function, effective power utilisation, by 11\%. This reduction in operated variable variability enabled a test campaign where the mill was controlled at various operating regions in order to establish the conditions conducive to the finest product size at a given mill feed rate. Moving the mill operating region from the benchmarked plant to the optimal grind environment and stabilising the mill at this point with the model predictive controller provided an estimated potential recovery increase of 0.32\% (absolute) due to better liberation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The main aspects of designing the circuit are discussed along with the issues faced in the early stages of operation. A review of the optimization strategy applied to the milling circuit such as cyclone optimization, advanced process control strategy implementation and reline management to improve availability is then discussed highlighting areas of significant process improvement that have seen the plant exceed nameplate throughputs above nine million tonnes per annum.},

SAG mills are very complex systems involving important nonlinearities and unmeasured disturbances which make the process very dificult to control. In the last decades approaches varying from decentralized PID control to multivariable predictive control have been applied to control of SAG mills with variable success; at the same time, new sensors has been developed with the aim to provide real time measurements of important variables currently unmeasured. The recent availability of new measurements, such as ore size distribution, has faced control engineers with the problem of obtaining new models, and designing new control algorithms capable of both, providing mathematical relations describing SAG mills' behavior, and incorporating the new measurements in determining the control law. In this work, real time measurements obtained using a WipFrag R visual sensor are used in order to obtain a qualitative characterization and a dynamic model of SAG mill's performance when faced to disturbances in the ore size distribution. Results obtained show that the two parameters of the Rosin-Rammler distribution, n and xc, delivered by WipFrag R are the best option for characterizing the ore size distribution.

"Optimal control theory has had very limited application in mineral processing practice. The reason for this has been the lack of accurate on-line models, the complicated nature of the mathematics and a lack of inexpensive computing power" (Herbst et al 1988:275)
"This is true because of the highly variable nature of feed materials, frequent mechanical disturbances in a plant and the presence of strongly interacting variables which can and often are manipulated simultaneously in any given control strategy" (Herbst et al 1988:275)
"These problems do in fact provide the basis for rich opportunities through dynamic optimization" (Herbst et al 1988:275)
"In the past, optimization of a process was usually associated with finding the optimum steady state inputs and automatic control was usually associated with the stabilization of the process and the two areas (optimization and automatic control) were not connected" (Herbst et al 1988:275)
"it is possible to dynamically optimize a process with a control strategy in order to adapt to changes in feed materia or operating condition" (Herbst et al 1988:275)

"the optimum gain constants for proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers depend upon the character of the ore and operating condition" (Herbst et al 1988:276)
"PID controllers in a grinding circuit can be tuned for very fast response when the ore is soft but when the ore is hard the controller gains will have to be reduced since the reaction of the grinding circuit to control actions is increased and the possibility of overload is greater" (Herbst et al 1988:276)
"Optimal control, in contrast, incorporates mathematical models into the control strategy so that information about interactions, process parameter variations and other disturbances is available in order to provide the best possible control performance" (Herbst et al 1988:276)
"an example of the application of optimal control to an industrial rod/ball mill circuit is presented" (Herbst et al 1988:276)

"The practical implementation of an optimal control strategy can be a formidable task that requires three major steps" (Herbst et al 1988:277)
"(1) the development of an on-line model of the comminution circuit; (2) the development of algorithms for optimal estimation and control of the process (state) variables; and (3) the development of interfaces between the operator and the strategy, the engineer and the strategy and the strategy and the control hardware" (Herbst et al 1988:277)
"An integrated software package that allows a plant engineer without intensive training in optimal control to set-up and implement such a strategy must include software for: (1) mathematical models for process units and plants (2) plant state estimation techniques; (3) optimal control algorithms and controllers; (4) real-time control system interface; and (5) interactive tuning and testing of control strategies" (Herbst et al 1988:277)

"modeling errors are introduced since the real process is subject to unknown random disturbance" (Herbst et al 1988:280)
"This controller is also known as a linear quadratic gaussian (LQG) controller since it minimizes a quadratic performance index for a stochastic linear system with gaussian statistics" (Herbst et al 1988:280)
"The Kalman filter estimator is a powerful means to obtain an on-line estimate" (Herbst et al 1988:280)
"The Kalman filter does this by optimally combining model predictions and measurements to yield an improved estimate" (Herbst et al 1988:280)
"A critical source of model error originate from the linearization of the nonlinear model and depends upon how the linearization is performed" (Herbst et al 1988:280)

	abstract = {Optimization is a pivotal point in distinguishing the competitiveness of industries that are developing, designing and operating various products and processes. Mineral processing is an industry which operates various subprocesses and produces one or several products. The sub-processes involved are dynamic in nature and differ in the discipline of operation. These dynamic sub-processes are sequentially integrated forming a mineral processing system. Currently, the developed simulations for the mineral processing systems have the potential to be used to design, operate and control mineral processing plants to an increased extent, but need broader optimization strategies to integrate multiple sub-processes involved. The scope of this research is to demonstrate application of multi-disciplinary optimization (MDO) architectures into a mineral processing simulation. A simulation study consisting of two sub-processes of comminution and classification circuits to produce aggregate products is used to demonstrate the application of MDO architectures. The MDO architectures are compared based on problem formulation, computational resources required and validity of the results. The optimization results using MDO architectures can be used to illustrate trade-offs between different sub-processes within the considered scope. The application of MDO architectures can facilitate the linking mathematical models of various disciplines such as comminution, and liberation in mineral processing simulation.},

	abstract = {A hybrid non-linear model predictive controller (HNMPC) is developed for a run-of-mine ore grinding mill circuit. A continuous-time grinding mill circuit model is presented with a hydrocyclone cluster as the primary classifier. The discrete-time component is the switching of hydrocyclones in the hydrocyclone cluster. The resulting model is a hybrid non-linear model with both continuous and discrete dynamics. A simulation of the HNMPC shows the advantages of using the hydrocyclone cluster as an additional manipulated variable. The advantages of the HNMPC is illustrated by comparing its performance to a non-linear MPC where no switching of hydrocyclones is possible. The genetic algorithm based HNMPC showed increased controller stability in its ability to incorporate discrete dynamics into the controller directly. The methods discussed in this paper can be used to incorporate different types of discrete dynamics into advanced grinding mill circuit controllers due to the modular presentation of the model and HNMPC controller design.},

"Because of the interaction between the control objectives for quality and throughput, the aim is to maintain quality as close to the minimum specification as set by the downstream processes, thereby maximizing throughput even in the presence of large disturbances" (Botha et al 2018:49)
"the product size distribution specification for the grinding mill circuit is continuously set by the separation circuit to improve the separation circuit's economic performance" (Botha et al 2018:49)
"The economic evaluation of a grinding mill circuit is done by using the relationship between the grinding mill circuit product particle size and the separation concentrate recovery and grade curve" (Botha et al 2018:49)
"continuous-time grinding mill circuit model is presented with a hydrocyclone cluster as the primary classifier" (Botha et al 2018:49)
"Although the local optimisation objectives for the grinding mill circuit is to maintain a constant product fineness and maximise throughput, the key revenue generating variable for the mineral processing plant is the concentrate grade of the downstream process" (Botha et al 2018:49)
"Economic plant-wide optimisation for a mineral processing plant is therefore limited to the operating range of the grinding mill circuit" (Botha et al 2018:49)
"Due to this limitation, grinding mill circuit controllers should be designed to optimise over a wide range of steady-state regions, incorporate various different controlled and manipulated variables (MVs), and benefit from all dynamics in the circuit" (Botha et al 2018:49)
"reject upstream disturbances quickly" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"The norm for industrial milling circuit control is single-loop proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers despite strong interactions between the loops" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"Single loop PID controllers do not allow for any trade-off between the control objectives" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"Therefore, if one of the loops hit a constraint, the other loops cannot attempt to offset the resulting set-point error" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"A variety of multivariable controllers were developed to achieve the optimal trade off between the control objectives and improvements in product quality, throughput, and power consumption" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"The design of advanced multivariable controllers involves identifying additional MVs to improve the circuit's operating region" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"In Craig et al. (1992) the range of quality control was increased by independently manipulating the mill's water feed-rate instead of fixing the water feed-rate as a ratio of the ore feed-rate" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"Similarly in Botha et al. (2015) the range of quality control was increased by manually switching cyclones in a hydrocyclone cluster" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"Power consumption reduction while maintaining quality was achieved in Estrada (2014) by alternating between different stockpiles as ore feed and whether a secondary grinding stage is used or not" (Botha et al 2018:50)

"One of the most common advanced process control methods is model predictive control (MPC)" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"Non-linear MPC (NMPC) follows the same principle of operation as a linear MPC, except a non-linear model is used to predict the plant outputs and the solver should be able to cope with possible local minima and non-linear models" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"The controller was capable of controlling over a larger operating region than linear MPC controllers" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"The key drawbacks in using model based predictive controllers is model mismatch because of the difficulty to estimate model parameters and complex solutions with unrealistic execution intervals" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"technological improvements (in the form of multi-core processors) have made it possible to implement non-linear MPC controllers with complex models in real time" (Botha et al 2018:50)

"The work in this study builds on Botha et al. (2015) where the benefits of switching hydrocyclones in and out of a cluster are shown" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"The controller benefits from a larger operating region due to the non-linear model, and being able to switch the discrete components thereby further increasing the operating region" (Botha et al 2018:50)
"A closed single-stage grinding mill circuit with a hydrocyclone cluster" (Botha et al 2018:51)
"qualitatively accurate and can be used for predictive controller design" (Botha et al 2018:51)
"In Xiao et al. (2010), Esmin et al. (2005) the HMPC controller used particle swarm optimisation (PSO) to solve the objective function" (Botha et al 2018:56)
"The genetic algorithm (GA) is a solver that has shown advantage over solvers such as PSO because of its ability to accommodate strong non-linearities, large variations in initial "guess" inputs, mixed integer dynamics (with various switching components) and convergence to a global minimum in the presence of many local minima" (Botha et al 2018:56)
"During the dynamic simulation the HNMPC showed promise in switching cyclones to maintain operating setpoints" (Botha et al 2018:59)
"the HNMPC can anticipate when switching is required and can therefore reject disturbances more quickly" (Botha et al 2018:59)
"Over the duration of the simulation the PSE performance for the HNMPC was double that of the NMPC as the average particle size error squared was halved with the HNMPC" (Botha et al 2018:59)
"transport delays were omitted" (Botha et al 2018:59)
"ideal sensors and actuators were assumed" (Botha et al 2018:59)
"full-state feedback was used" (Botha et al 2018:59)
"Implementing an HNMPC is similar to implementing an NMPC which is becoming easier to implement due to the increased availability of suitable vendor platforms" (Botha et al 2018:60)
"What remains a challenge is to accurately model the plant to be controlled, and to keep this model up to date" (Botha et al 2018:60)
"The key contribution as shown in this study was that there is underlying benefit in incorporating discrete process input variables in the controller formulation" (Botha et al 2018:60)

"The aims of this survey are to determine how milling circuits are currently controlled, and to find out how key process variables are linked to economic benefits" (Wei and Craig 2009:56)
"The primary objective of control systems is to maximise benefits" (Wei and Craig 2009:56)
"systematic procedure for the economic assessment of process control, was proposed in Bauer and Craig (2008)" (Wei and Craig 2009:56)
"that the product particle size, slurry level in the sump, and sump discharge slurry density are the three most frequently used controlled variables." (Wei and Craig 2009:57)
"The mill load and slurry level in the sump are usually open-loop unstable, requiring some form of control" (Wei and Craig 2009:57)
"The flow rate of water to the sump, flow rate of water to the mill, feed rate of solids to the mill, and flow rate of slurry from the sump are all frequently adopted as manipulated variables" (Wei and Craig 2009:57)
"The efficiency of the downstream process is of primary importance (89\%). Circuit throughput is also an important factor (53\%)." (Wei and Craig 2009:57)
"Two main actions taken to grind finer than expected are to decrease the feed rate of solids to the mill and to increase the flow rate of water to the sump. These actions are mainly performed manually (62\%)" (Wei and Craig 2009:57)
"the stability of the system is the first priority (78\%). Maintaining a margin of safety is the second choice (67\%)." (Wei and Craig 2009:57)
"The most frequent action taken, when the sump level is too low, is to increase the feed rate of water to the sump (47\%). To reduce the feed rate of slurry from the sump discharge is of secondary importance (39\%)." (Wei and Craig 2009:57)
"When the sump level is higher than the setpoint, most (94\%) of the respondents indicated that spilled slurry needed to be handled, which would lead to some costs.

"The main contributors are control hardware, consultant manpower cost, and cost of technology" (Wei and Craig 2009:59)
"This is in contrast to results reported in Bauer and Craig (2008) where manpower cost was dominant and control hardware played a lesser role." (Wei and Craig 2009:59)

Model equations are based on conventional non-stationary population balance approach to develop the necessary dynamic model of the semi-autogenous mill operation. The model is able to predict the time-evolution of key operating variables such as product flow rate, level charge, power-draw and load position, as function of other important variables such as mill rotational speed and fresh feed characteristics. The set of ordinary differential equations was solved using MATLAB/SIMULINK as a graphic programming platform, a very helpful tool for understanding the grinding phenomenon. Using an on-line parameter estimator, the simulator was tested and validated at an 1800 t/h copper-ore mill showing the effectiveness of the system to track the dynamic behaviour of the variables. It is now being used for the study of advanced control schemes. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	title = {Surface {XRF} {Mapping} for {Intraparticle} {Heterogeneity} {Assessment} and {Particle} {Grade} {Estimation}},
	abstract = {Sensor-based sorting is perceived as a feasible solution for some of the most critical aspects of mineral processing. There are two basic classes of sensors, 1. those that measure a property characteristic of the bulk of a particle; and 2. those that measure a property of the surface of a particle. For the second class, the surface measurement is then correlated to the bulk property of interest. The correlation does not only depend on how well the sensors can analyze the surface, but also on how well the surface correlates to the volume of the rock. The correlation is even more complex since only part of the rock surface is scanned by an actual sorter. Thus, the heterogeneity within each particle, defined as intraparticle heterogeneity, is an important variable to be characterized. The main objective of this work was to design and develop a method for rock surface mapping to assess intraparticle heterogeneity and to evaluate the correlation between surface grade and bulk grade for run of the mine or primary crushed rocks. The XRF mapping technique developed, and the procedure selected to analyze the mapping data, were described and applied to two porphyry copper ore samples. According to an univariate statistical analysis, for the samples analyzed, copper and iron data distributions did not follow either normal or lognormal distribution. Median and median absolute deviation were proposed as the best parameters to summarize the surface grade and the intraparticle heterogeneity, respectively. The median value of the surface grade data showed the best correlation to the bulk grade of the rock for both elements. For the copper ore used in this work, with mainly vein type mineralization, the one-dimensional heterogeneity assessment showed a high degree of intraparticle heterogeneity. This characteristic of the ore might generate poor reproducibility in the results of an XRF sorter when sensing only one face of each rock. The variogram was evaluated as a measure of heterogeneity in two dimensions. Two-color mapping method was selected to display the data collected in the XRF mapping for both samples analyzed.},

	abstract = {The Unified Comminution Model (UCM) endeavours to provide a framework for all comminution devices. It is based on the premise that comminution is a fundamental process, and that the same processes apply in all comminution devices, only in different proportions and at different intensities. Unlike the models in common use, this one models the process, not the outcomes of a particular device. This is a particle property based model, based on a series of probability functions that control the rate, types, energy, force of contacts, and contact partners. This intrinsically allows for multi-component modelling, preferential breakage, and liberation. The UCM is underpinned by computational modelling, and the DEM is currently the prime tool. It is envisaged that the model structure will be used to model novel comminution devices, and provide true full circuit comparison simulations, that include the key parameter of liberation. This paper presents the structure of such a model and details the type of information that will be integral to the development.},

	abstract = {Chemical and mineral processing industries commonly commission linear feedback controllers to control unit processes over a narrow and linear operating region where the economy of the process is maximized. However, most of these processes are non- linear outside of this narrow operating region. In the event of a large unmeasured disturbance, a process can shift away from nominal and into an abnormal operating region. Owing to the nonlinearity of these processes, a linear controller tuned for the nominal operating region will perform poorly and possibly lead to an unstable closed-loop system in an abnormal operating region. Moreover, it is often di?cult to determine whether a process has shifted to an abnormal operating region if none of the constraints on the measured process outputs are violated. In these events, it is the operator who must detect and recover the process, and this manual response results in a sub-optimal recovery. This thesis develops and demonstrates a control strategy that monitors several process variables simultaneously and provides an estimate of the process shift to a nonlinear abnormal operating region where a linear recovery controller is implemented to recover the process back to nominal. To monitor the process, principal component analysis is proposed for process shifts that can be detected by linear variable trans- formations. Alternatively, for nonlinear or high-dimensional processes, locally linear embedding is proposed. Once a process shift to an abnormal operating region is detected, the control strat- egy uses the estimate of the process shift in a recovery controller to recover the process. In the event the linear recovery controller is unable to recover the process, an expert system overrides the recovery controller to return the process to a recoverable region. A case study on a semi-autogenous grinding mill at a processing facility in British Columbia presents the successful application of the control strategy to detect and recover the mill from overloading. Portions of this control strategy have been imple- mented at this facility, and it provides the operators with a real-time estimate on the magnitude of the mill overload.},

A Design of Experiment (DOE) approach is used to define a series simulation conditions with the two factors being the lifter height and the fill level. The charge structure is characterised by the locations of the head, shoulder, bulk toe and impact toe. These are determined by visual analysis of the particle trajectories. The spatial variation of the liner pressure distribution can provide valuable information on the structure of the charge. This was found to vary systematically with lifter height and fill level. The relationships between the visual key locations and the key features of the pressure distributions were identified and found to be well described by linear equations. Finally, parametric models are fitted to the DEM data for both the lifter height and fill level allowing them to be estimated from measurements of the key charge locations. These could be used as part of a control strategy for the mill and/or to assist with re-line scheduling.},

	abstract = {Comminution, particularly milling, is on average the largest consumer of energy in mining. Actual comminution circuits consist in most of the cases in coarse crushing, SAG milling, pebble crushing and secondary ball milling. In these circuits the SAG mill is the largest energy consumer. In many engineering projects either a power equation and/or a specific energy equation are used for the designing of these mills but not always with acceptable results. In general these equations are used to predict power consumption as a function of mill size, level and density of the internal charge and \% of critical speed. Almost none of these equations (with the notable exception of the Morrell{\textquoteright}s model) consider explicitly the effect that the feed particle size has on the mill performance, particularly on the power and on the specific energy consumption of the mill. To address this fact new models are developed in this work able to predict power or specific energy consumption, including the usual design variables, but adding a variable that represents the feed size distribution. Operational data from 4 grinding circuits corresponding to 3 Chilean copper concentration plants are used and the \% {\`A}600 +100 ({\`A}152 +25 mm) is selected as independent variable. The results indicate that both models are able to estimate the required variables for all data sets. In the first model (power equation) the average error obtained was 3.7\% and in the second model (specific energy) the average error was 6.8\%. These models would be useful for performance optimisation of the test case mills and should be fitted (parameters values) again for other mills.},

"This expert system used fresh feed tonnage, content of solids (water flow added to the mill) and mill speed to achieve its control objectives" (Yutronic et al :26)
"Note that important grinding disturbances, such as feed ore size were not considered at all by the expert system, nor by the manual control done by the operator over the SAG1011 process" (Yutronic et al :27)
"MPC has some interesting advantages, like: x It is particularly attractive because the underlying concepts are very intuitive and it is simple to tune. x It can be used in a wide variety of processes, from the simple ones to processes with complex dynamics and large dead times, no-minimum phase zeros, unstable or multivariable systems. x Its predictive characteristics compensate intrinsically dead times and disturbances (feed forward). x It allows handling the process constraints explicitly." (Yutronic et al :28)
"It is clear that the SAG's processes are not a linear system, so the process is maintained around an operation point, however, if the system changes its operation point, the model represented varies, however, the changes are handled by the controller robustness to compensate the model mismatch (in these cases tuning has been required)."

"The dynamic models used by the MPC controller have been identified mostly using historical data of manual operation. In some cases the historical data was not frequency rich enough; therefore some step testing was necessary." (Yutronic et al :33)
"further step-testing and process model identification was carried out, in order to retune MPC in the new (and most demanding) operational point" (Yutronic et al :34)
"At the very last stage of these continuous improvements, a new controlled variable was added to the MPC, since mill's winding temperatures could not rise over a certain limit in order to prevent serious damage on the mill's gearless drive" (Yutronic et al :34)
"MPC implementation for the secondary grinding and classification stage began with a control strategy redefinition: the level loop was eliminated. Sump level should be controlled by adjusting water flows or pump speeds. Furthermore, sump level will no longer be controlled with a setpoint; instead, a desired range was considered, therefore minimizing movements that reinforce coupling.

	abstract = {The JKMRC AGISAG model typically requires a full scale plant or pilot mill survey combined with ore breakage testing to generate a set of grinding rates. However recent research using a large data base of pilot and full scale milling tests has lead to the development of a correlation between model grinding rates and mill operating conditions. A further correlation between mill feed sizing and ore breakage characteristics has also been developed. These two correlations now allow mill performance to be predicted for a wide range of mill sizes and operating conditions. Hence the model can be used to evaluate optimisation strategies in existing plants and to investigate (and compare) grinding circuit configurations at the pre-feasibility stage thus reducing the cost of pilot testing. A comparison of this design method vs actual measured performance including power is provided for a range of AGISAG mills and product sizes. The model is also used to describe in detail the effects of changing operating conditions.},

When equipment is in order, loops are put back in automatic mode. If a loop oscillates, use standard default values for this type of loop.

The fourth phase consists in analyzing the process and expected performances in order to optimize the control loops and control strategies.

The pebbles crusher is often oversized, and thus not fully utilized. The hypothesis put forward in this paper is that active control of the cone crusher{\textquoteright}s eccentric speed and closed side setting (CSS) can increase throughput and/or energy efficiency of the SAG circuit. To verify this hypothesis, a dynamic model of a SAG mill-pebble crusher circuit was implemented. The dynamic unit models are based on results presented by several different researchers, whose results here have been combined and implemented in Matlab/Simulink. Previous research shows that by controlling the cone crusher operational parameters, the product particle size distribution (PSD) can be altered during operation. However, few papers have been published about whether the changes of the pebbles crusher{\textquoteright}s product PSD, lead to a higher performance of the SAG circuit. This paper examines the relations between the SAG mill and the pebble crusher in closed circuit while putting emphasis on controlling the pebble crusher in order to optimize the circuit throughput.},

A cyclone underflow-angle meter is used to increase the {\textquoteleft}practical{\textquoteright} range of feed flow to the cyclone, which in turn further increases the range over which the particle size can be controlled.

"Results from long-term tests indicate the mill inlet-water flow can be used as a 'steady-state' control action to increase the range over which the particle size can be controlled." (Craig et al 1992:203)
"the particle size control described by Hulbert et al. [l] is believed to be a world first." (Craig et al 1992:203)
"The optimization of the ROM circuit included extended particle-size control and throughput optimization." (Craig et al 1992:203)
"Two ultrasound-based instruments, called particle-size monitors (PSMs), are available on the market for the on-line measurement of particle size" (Craig et al 1992:203)
"As milling circuits are inherently multivariable in nature, multivariable controller (MVC) design techniques had to be applied to effectively control the product size to a setpoint." (Craig et al 1992:203)
"Hulbert [4] showed that a multivariable control scheme could be employed to control the product size of a conventional milling circuit." (Craig et al 1992:203)
"Product-size control of ROM milling circuits is more difficult since the main grinding medium and the feed rate of the ore to the mill are not independent." (Craig et al 1992:204)
"Due to the ROM nature of the feed material, there is also no or very little control over the size and hardness of the grinding medium." (Craig et al 1992:204)
"This results in significant uncontrolled disturbances entering the circuit" (Craig et al 1992:204)
"control and optimization strategies for ROM and SAG milling circuits reported on in the literature mainly concentrate their efforts on grinding media control, e.g. PI, [71, [81 and [91. These methods are essentially based upon adjusting the mill feed-rate (and possibly composition) in order to achieve a certain power draw from the mill motor" (Craig et al 1992:204)
"Herbst et al. [9] use Kalman filtering techniques to estimate certain milling parameters on-line, from which the feed-rate necessary to achieve a desired power draw is determined" (Craig et al 1992:204)
"A suitable PSM setpoint is chosen so that the downstream process can extract the maximum amount of gold from the milling-circuit product, or to meet some other production requirements. The MVC will then control the PSM to its setpoint, and the optimizer will maximize the throughput of the milling circuit at that specific PSM setpoint" (Craig et al 1992:204)},

	abstract = {The best accepted method for design of autogenous and semi-autogenous (AG/SAG) mills is to carry out pilot scale test work using a 1.8 m diameter by 0.6 m long pilot scale test mill. The load in such a mill typically contains 250,000{\textendash}450,000 particles larger than 6 mm, allowing correct representation of more than 90\% of the charge in Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations. Most AG/SAG mills use discharge grate slots which are 15 mm or more in width. The mass in each size fraction usually decreases rapidly below grate size. This scale of DEM model is now within the possible range of standard workstations running an efficient DEM code. This paper describes various ways of extracting collision data from the DEM model and translating it into breakage estimates. Account is taken of the different breakage mechanisms (impact and abrasion) and of the specific impact histories of the particles in order to assess the breakage rates for various size fractions in the mills. At some future time, the integration of smoothed particle hydrodynamics with DEM will allow for the inclusion of slurry within the pilot mill simulation.},

	abstract = {The Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation of charge motion in ball, semi-autogenous (SAG) and autogenous mills has advanced to a stage where the effects of lifter design, power draft and product size can be evaluated with sufficient accuracy using either two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) codes. While 2D codes may provide a reasonable profile of charge distribution in the mill there is a difference in power estimations as the anisotropic nature within the mill cannot be neglected. Thus 3D codes are preferred as they can provide a more accurate estimation of power draw and charge distribution. While 2D codes complete a typical industrial simulation in the order of hours, 3D codes require computing times in the order of days to weeks on a typical multi-threaded desktop computer. A newly developed and recently introduced 3D DEM simulation environment is BLAZE-DEM that utilizes the Graphical Processor Unit (GPU) via the NVIDIA CUDA programming model. Utilizing the parallelism of the GPU a 3D simulation of an industrial mill with four million particles takes 1 h to simulate one second (20 FPS) on a GTX 880 laptop GPU. This new performance level may allow 3D simulations to become a routine task for mill designers and researchers. This paper makes two notable extensions to the BLAZE-DEM environment. Firstly, the sphere-face contact is extended to include a GPU efficient sphere-edge contact strategy. Secondly, the world representation is extended by an efficient representation of convex geometrical primitives that can be combined to form non-convex world boundaries that drastically enhances the efficiency of particle world contact. In addition to these extensions this paper verifies and validates our GPU code by comparing charge profiles and power draw obtained using the CPU based code Millsoft and pilot scale experiments. Finally, we conclude with plant scale mill simulations.},

	abstract = {A conventional grinding circuit consisting of one open-loop rod mill and one closed-loop ball mill is essentially a two-input= twooutput system, assuming that the classifier pump box level is controlled by a local loop. The inputs are the ore and water feed rates and the outputs are the product fineness and the circulating load. The design problem is to find a control algorithm and a tuning procedure which satisfy specified servo and regulatory robust performances. A first approach is to use decentralized PID controllers and systematic tuning methods which take into account loop interactions. Another technique consists of adding decouplers or pseudo-decouplers to the decentralized controllers. Finally, the design of a fully multivariable controller is a possible option. To face the problem of performance robustness related to change of process dynamics, two options are studied. A design criterion involving the minimization of a penalized quadratic function on a future trajectory can be used. A second alternative is to track process dynamics changes using adaptive process modelling. The paper will present a comparison of these various strategies, for a simulated grinding circuit. A benchmark test, involving a sequence of disturbances {\v Z}grindability, feed size distribution, change of cyclone number . . . . and setpoint changes, is used to compare the performances of the controllers. q 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

	abstract = {It is now well accepted that process automation, closed-loop control and optimisation technologies enable higher feed rates, more consistent product qualities, lower utility usage and higher yields in a diverse range of process industries. In the minerals processing industry, as a general rule, it is advisable to consider the grinding circuit first, as good operation here is necessary for stable operation in the rest of the plant. Operating conditions in a grinding circuit are frequently such that production is significantly reduced due to the effects of process disturbances, most notably those associated with the feed ore. This paper demonstrates the design of a robust control scheme for a semiautogenous grinding (SAG) mill. Feedback (FB), feedback plus feedforward (FF) and reduced order (i.e. less complex) robust controllers were all developed and tested{\textemdash}each providing tight control over the SAG mill power draw by adjusting the feed rate to the mill. This example clearly shows that using the available Matlab-based controller design package, it is possible to develop robust (i.e. in terms of strict guarantees on both controller performance and stability, despite model uncertainties) control systems for the minerals industry as readily as for other industries where advanced control is more routinely used.

"By putting all time derivatives equal to zero, the dynamic SAG mill model is converted to a steady-state model comprising a set of nonlinear algebraic equations (which were solved using the Matlab package)" (Gal{\'a}n et al 2002:266)
"In general terms, the benefits sought from improved primary grinding circuit control include increasing throughput at the desired grind size, reduction of grinding ball consumption and minimisation of the SAG mill power requirement" (Gal{\'a}n et al 2002:266)
"In the absence of an adequate control system, any disturbance to the process will be reflected in changes to the solids hold-up within the SAG mill, changes in the circulating loads, and eventually changes in the size distribution of the product sent on to the flotation circuit" (Gal{\'a}n et al 2002:266)
"In the plant under consideration, the major constraint on maximising the feed rate to the plant is the limitation on the" (Gal{\'a}n et al 2002:266)
"SAG mill draw power" (Gal{\'a}n et al 2002:267)
"If the feed size distribution were to increase and/or the feed were to became harder, then more solid material would be held up in the SAG mill, which would draw more power" (Gal{\'a}n et al 2002:267)
"this study concentrated on designing a controller whose objective was to keep the SAG mill power at a set value (somewhat below the maximum permissible) by manipulating the ore fresh feed rate" (Gal{\'a}n et al 2002:267)
"The simplest controller would employ feedback (FB) only control by adjusting the SAG mill feed rate to maintain the SAG mill power draw at its set-point value. As with any feedback controller, such a system can only take action after a disturbance has affected the process and caused a measurable deviation from the set-point. A simple remedy here is to include a feedforward (FF) control loop that also adjusts the SAG mill power draw, but this time on the basis of a measurement of the disturbance(s) affecting the system" (Gal{\'a}n et al 2002:267)
"A feedback-feedforward (FB-FF) control system should reduce the effects of disturbances propagated downstream through the process (here to the flotation circuit)" (Gal{\'a}n et al 2002:267)
"Hardness and size distribution are known to be correlated{\textemdash}in that a coarse feed is generally the result of a hard ore, and vice versa" (Gal{\'a}n et al 2002:267)
"Thus, the only disturbance considered in this study was the feed size distribution (as measured by the F80 parameter) for which a number of measurement devices are already available on the market" (Gal{\'a}n et al 2002:267)
"one such robust design technique will be presented and used to design an FB-FF controller that meets all user-specified performance and stability requirements" (Gal{\'a}n et al 2002:267)
"A dynamic model of an industrial primary grinding circuit has been developed" (Gal{\'a}n et al 2002:268)
"The SAG mill component of this dynamic model was used to design and test a robust controller whose aim was to maximise feed throughput by maintaining the SAG mill draw power close to its maximum permissible level" (Gal{\'a}n et al 2002:268)
"The SAG mill example used in this study is a simple single-input single-output (SISO) system. One of the major attractions of this methodology is that it can be readily used to design robust multivariable controllers that take account of all control loop interactions while still guaranteeing all user specified stability and performance requirements" (Gal{\'a}n et al 2002:268)
"The classical approach to feedback controller design has followed a frequency domain approach, where for a given single-input single-output (SISO) plant described by the linear transfer function model gp (s), a controller k1 (s) is designed, such that the closed-loop system satisfies the basic requirements of stability, performance and robustness" (Gal{\'a}n et al 2002:268)
"The last design requirement, robustness, asks for both stability and performance to be maintained not only for a nominal plant model, but also for a set of neighbouring plant models that result from the unavoidable presence of modelling errors (generally referred to as model uncertainties)" (Gal{\'a}n et al 2002:269)
"The first step in the design of a robust controller for the SAG mill involves obtaining linear dynamic models (expressed as transfer functions) for the impact of the manipulated variable (i.e. feed flowrate) and the disturbance (i.e. the F80 parameter) on the variable to be controlled (i.e. the SAG mill power draw)."

	abstract = {Successful control of Semi-Autogenous Grinding (SAG) mill circuits has been the subject of many researches and main concern of plant operators for years. Distributed Control Systems (DCS) have had some degree of success in the mineral processing circuits, but maintaining operation of a SAG mill on the {\textquotedblleft}edge{\textquotedblright} of its full capacity is not easily achievable by DCS. Advanced control systems, however, are a relatively new opportunity to successful control of mineral processing plants. This article presents the basis of a supervisory fuzzy expert controller for SAG mill circuits. Although leading companies in control and automation have their own commercial packages, this supervisory controller is coded in Matlab using Mamdani method and is able to connect to plant lower level control system. In the proposed controller, fuzzy system calculates optimum set points to the plant DCS control loops, enabling them to change the manipulating parameters to reach the new set points. This controller was installed, tested and verified in a copper grinding circuit. Results showed 1.8\% increase in mill throughput, 3\% decrease in power draw and more stable feeding regime at the same time.},

"One of the drawbacks of the DCS systems is that, new set points should be calculated by "operators" and defined to the DCS "manually." This will raise two issues: (a) which manipulating variable should be selected for applying necessary control action? (b) What should be the value of new set point for the selected manipulating variable?" (Hadizadeh et al 2017:169)
"It is obvious that, different operators can make different decisions under the same situation which mainly depends on the level of their knowledge and experience" (Hadizadeh et al 2017:169)

"Based on the set point tracking results shown in Table 5, the FuzzyMPC scheme was selected for long term process data simulation." (Remes et al 2010:76)
"Strong interactions between the process variables set challenges to the modeling task; it turned out that the most suitable model structures were transfer functions defining the input output dynamic separately for each variable." (Remes et al 2010:77)
"The control development, tuning, and performance evaluation were conducted in a simulation environment, established based on the experimental dynamic models" (Remes et al 2010:77)
"from the viewpoint of long term maintenance, fuzzy control is based on readily manageable rule base" (Remes et al 2010:78)
"Also, fuzzy control is well suited for discrete control actions, such as valve opening and closing, used here for control of the circulating load" (Remes et al 2010:78)
"A relatively long (one week) process data simulation with a fuzzyMPC scheme confirmed the advantages of closed loop particle size control" (Remes et al 2010:78)
"During the whole period the control system reduced variation of the coarse fraction 67\%, and even during one feed ore heap the reduction was 26\%, while keeping the circulating load in operating limits by automated manipulation of the hydrocyclone valve pattern." (Remes et al 2010:78)
"Moreover, the ore feed rate increased an average 1.8\% within the data period. Apparently, better control of the slurry particle size distribution has a favorable impact onflotation recovery, possibly still increasing the plant capacity" (Remes et al 2010:78)
"this control assessment gives a proper insight for forthcoming grinding circuit control strategy implementations." (Remes et al 2010:78)},

The strategies presented were compared and, according to theory, exhibit good behavior. The extended horizon, pole-placement and model reference multivariable adaptive control strategies were formulated in discrete-time and use a model of the plant whose parameters are updated on line using the recursive least squares method along with UD factorization of the covariance matrix and variable forgetting factor. The direct Nyquist array and sequential loop closing techniques were also studied and simulated. The two-bytwo multivariable system chosen to represent the grinding plant has the percentage of solids ?density? of the pulp fed to the hydrocyclones ?which is highly correlated with the percentage of ?65 mesh in the overflow of hydrocyclones? and the sump level as output ?controlled? variables. The water flow added to the sump and the speed of the pump are its input ?manipulated? variables. All the algorithms tested by simulation exhibited good performance and were able to control the grinding plant in a stable fashion. Adaptive algorithms showed better performance than classical techniques, with the extended horizon and pole-placement algorithms proving to be the best. The fact that adaptive algorithms continuously adjust their parameters renders such controllers superior to those based on fixed parameters. {\textcopyright} 2002 ISA{\textemdash}The Instrumentation, Systems, and Automation Society.},

"Steady state simulators have been widely and successfully used in plant design and equipment sizing, circuit optimization, troubleshooting and cost minimization" (Khoshnam et al 2015:12)

"Some of these simulators and also most of the simulators developed for process control purposes apply empirical dynamic models of the system in the form of continuous or discrete transfer functions [14-17], ignoring the real phenomenological interdependencies of variables" (Khoshnam et al 2015:12)

	abstract = {A model of autogenous and semi-autogenous grinding mills has been developed which can be used to predict the performance of different ore types in mills of different size.

The approach was based on ore specific appearance functions. Pendulum and tumbling tests on ore samples were conducted to describe quantitatively the high and low energy breakage of different ore types. The energy levels in a mill were related to the mill diameter and charge. The effect of energy level on breakage was obtained from the pendulum tests. The laboratory results were complemented by operating data. Plant tests were conducted on mills at three different installations. Data and samples were also obtained from earlier tests on a different ore type in one of these mills. The initial model development ignored secondary effects such as mill discharge density and circulating loads. These were included specifically in models for two cases.

The model was used to simulate n e w data not used in the original model development. After quantifying the effects of mill discharge density a nd circulating load, the model accurately predicted product size distributions for all of these additional surveys. No load sizings were available for any of these data but the model load predictions were of similar form to other observed load size distributions. Applications of the model for design and optimisation of circuits using simulation techniques are demonstrated.},

(Bill Gough 2011:14)"Enhancements to these strategies may include the use of feed particle size distribution, ore hardness, and ore type as predictors for mill grinding efficiency. Mill sound may also be used as an indicator of the tumbling profile inside the mill.

"The objective of this contribution is to make a survey of the progresses and challenges in the field of automatic control of the two main stages of an MP plant, namely ore comminution and mineral separation processes" (Hodouin 2001:11)
"problems inherent to the high level of complexity of the processed material are still there, leaving process engineers with more questions than answers." (Hodouin 2001:11)
"The aim of an MP operation is to concentrate a raw ore for the subsequent metal extraction stage" (Hodouin 2001:12)
"real-time plant-wide optimisation should be the right approach to MP plant control (Herbst, Pate, Flores, \& Zarate, 1995), i.e. the adjustment of the operating conditions of the various units as a function of the raw ore properties and feed rate, metal market prices and energy and reagent costs" (Hodouin 2001:12)
"An essential feature of control and optimisation strategies is the availability of mathematical models that accurately describe the steady-state and dynamic characteristics of the process in the whole operating range, including its non-linear behaviour." (Hodouin 2001:12)
"Satisfactory mathematical models are not frequently available.~ A first reason is that an ore is an exceptionally complex system compared to material such as those processed by the chemical, cement or paper industries." (Hodouin 2001:12)
"A second reason is that the physics and chemistry of the subprocesses involved are poorly understood" (Hodouin 2001:12)
"tonnage, the impurities contents and the operating costs Usually these objectives require some trade-off between the concentrate grade and" (Hodouin 2001:12)
"MP optimisation and control cannot be performed without a minimum amount of information on the input disturbances (the material properties), the process states, and the final product quality. This is in fact the bottleneck of MP control" (Hodouin 2001:12)
"essential properties such as grindability, mineral texture, liberation degree, surface activity, slurry rheology, grinding media size distribution, bubble size distribution and loading are extremely difficult to measure and even to infer from other measurements" (Hodouin 2001:13)
"There are various devices for particle size measurement in the fine size range. They can mechanically measure the particle size or infer it through physical phenomena such as laser diffraction or ultra-sound absorption" (Hodouin 2001:13)
"In the coarse size range, video images of the flowing particulate material are now processed to extract information on particle size. Measurements can be obtained during unloading trucks of run of mine (Herbst \& Blust, 2000), or, more usually from pictures of material on conveyors" (Hodouin 2001:13)
"X-ray fluorescence is the universal method for on-line solid composition measurement in MP plants. Equipment vendors now offer more efficient, compact, flexible and reliable devices" (Hodouin 2001:13)
"Measurement of the degree of liberation of the minerals, a property directly related to the particle composition distribution as a function of particle size, is an extremely complex problem. There is no available online instrument" (Hodouin 2001:13)
"In the grinding field, new devices are tested to monitor mill noise, shell vibrations and forces applied to lifters to infer properties such as ball and slurry loads, slurry viscosity, wear, shape and location of the hold-up" (Hodouin 2001:13)
"The main difficulty is to relate the recorded signals to physical properties of the system" (Hodouin 2001:13)
"Data reconciliation procedures are used to correct measurements and make it coherent with prior knowledge about the process" (Hodouin 2001:13)
"Frequently, mass conservation equations are used as a basic model to reconcile redundant data with prior knowledge constraints" (Hodouin 2001:13)
"At the same time, data reconciliation techniques are used to infer unmeasured process variables such as flowrate and composition of internal streams of a complex MP unit" (Hodouin 2001:14)
"The off-line reconciliation methods are mature and various computer packages are now available. On-line applications to stationary processes are active, while methods which make a trade-off between the model uncertainties and the measurement errors are now emerging" (Hodouin 2001:14)
"Soft sensors make use of simple models that calculate the values of the desired process variable as a function of other measured variables" (Hodouin 2001:14)
"Statistical or AI techniques are active or emerging to extract, from data sets, pieces of information which may be useful for monitoring, predictive maintenance, diagnosis, control and optimisation" (Hodouin 2001:14)
"Failures of advanced data processing or control methods in the MP industry are either due to sensor faults or to a lack of maintenance of the algorithms in the plant" (Hodouin 2001:14)
"In an MP operation there are hundreds of control loops. Most of them are local loops used for controlling actuators or inner loops in cascade control schemes" (Hodouin 2001:14)
"Typically, they are level, flow rate, and pH control loops" (Hodouin 2001:14)
"PI or PID algorithms, which are normally implemented at this lowest level of the plant control hierarchy, are to be tuned on a regular basis." (Hodouin 2001:14)
"Practically, a number of controllers are not well tuned and require new settings in order to improve the overall performance of the high level loops" (Hodouin 2001:14)
"Plant-wide optimisation is extremely difficult, due to the problem of linking grinding and separation processes through liberation measurement and modelling" (Hodouin 2001:14)
"As a consequence, comminution and separation processes are controlled with separate objectives and control strategies" (Hodouin 2001:15)
"Most of the time, only decentralized single-input-single-output (SISO) stabilising control is applied" (Hodouin 2001:15)
"For time variant and non-linear MP processes that undergo large unknown disturbances, these multiple SISO control loops sometimes exhibit poor performances" (Hodouin 2001:15)
"Three avenues are used to cope with these problems: multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) regulatory and supervisory optimising control based on mathematical models, AI techniques based on empirical or heuristics process models, and finally fuzzy logic or expert systems" (Hodouin 2001:15)
"Despite some plant success stories, applied MIMO regulatory control can still be considered as an active or emerging technology, since, most of the time, studies in this area are limited to theoretical works based on simulated plants." (Hodouin 2001:15)
"Application of adaptive, non-linear and robust control theories to the MP processes can essentially be considered as emerging" (Hodouin 2001:15)
"One major problem related to the slow diffusion of advanced control techniques is that they constitute a rather hermetic corpus of knowledge with its own jargon, exclusive to those in the scientific and engineering communities who are versed in applied mathematics" (Hodouin 2001:15)
"Another problem is the difficulty of establishing reliable mathematical process models, as already mentioned" (Hodouin 2001:15)
"Expert systems tools based on heuristic rules and fuzzy logic reasoning have proven to be especially successful in the MP control applications and can be considered as a mature technology" (Hodouin 2001:15)
"The fundamental objective of a grinding circuit is not size reduction, it is rather to liberate valuable minerals in such a way that the subsequent separation process can be operated at its maximum economic efficiency" (Hodouin 2001:15)
"In practice it is quite difficult to apply feedback control based on the economic value of the final concentrate (Fig. 1), for the reasons given above.Instead, control targets are defined for the particle size distribution (PSD) of the ground product on the basis of laboratory metallurgical tests." (Hodouin 2001:15)
"Usually the PSD setpoint is selected from a compromise, since too fine a grind maximises the mineral liberation degree but is energetically very costly and induces separation problems, while too coarse a grind decreases concentrate grade because of the presence of middlings" (Hodouin 2001:15)
"Theoretically, the PSD should be matched to the separation process recovery as a function of the particle size" (Hodouin 2001:15)
"Practically, the narrowest PSD is the size range of maximum recovery is obtained at the design or tuning stage of the grinding circuit, and the operation is controlled at a single target value defined by the percentage of particles finer than a given size." (Hodouin 2001:15)
"Occasionally, a circuit may be controlled at constant production rate trying to maximise the product fineness, but most of the time it is controlled at a fixed setpoint of the fineness, trying to maximise the production, i.e. minimising the energy consumed per ton of ore" (Hodouin 2001:15)
"The maximisation of the production is normally obtained by fixing an optimal value of the circulating load, but it can be also obtained by real-time optimisation strategies" (Hodouin 2001:15)
"Rod/ball millgrinding circuits The control strategies of these systems are quite mature, because the control problems are relatively simple." (Hodouin 2001:15)
"A few numbers of manipulable variables is available: the circuit feed rate and the water addition rates" (Hodouin 2001:15)
"Normally the water to the rod mill is simply made proportional to the ore feed rate, leaving mainly two control variables: the fresh ore feed rate and the water addition rate to the ball mill circuit" (Hodouin 2001:15)
"The sump box level is frequently controlled by a local control loop, when a variable-speed pump is available, otherwise it becomes a constraint of the controller" (Hodouin 2001:16)
"Also the ball mill and the hydrocyclone overflow and underflow densities are frequently processed as operating constraints" (Hodouin 2001:16)
"Control strategies are essentially constrained by two control systems where the output variables to be controlled are the PSD and the circulating load, or some other constraints when needed" (Hodouin 2001:16)
"The control problem is more complex than for rod/ ball mill grinding circuits, because the state variables, which characterise the mill load, play an essential role in the circuit efficiency" (Hodouin 2001:16)
"The power drawn by the mill is an increasing and then decreasing function of the mill load" (Hodouin 2001:16)},

Media wear arises as a consequence of complex interaction between a range of variables related to processing conditions, the characteristics of the media, as well as the ores or slurries, and is not well understood as yet, despite extensive study over the last 50 years and more. The three basic wear mechanisms, impact, abrasion and corrosion, can simultaneously influence mass loss in grinding media. Present studies are difficult to compare directly, owing to imprecise information with regard to the composition of the media or grinding conditions. As a result, most current models do not account for varying conditions inside the mill and their use is restricted to conditions similar to those associated with their calibration. This may not always be possible and alternative modelling methodologies are discussed and demonstrated by means of a case study on simulated data.},

	title = {Dynamic {Simulator} {For} {A} {Grinding} {Circuit}},
	abstract = {The grinding circuit is a primary and indispensable unit of a mineral processing plant. The product from a grinding circuit affects the recovery rate of minerals in subsequent downstream processes and governs the amount of concentrate produced. Because of the huge amount of energy required during the grinding operation, they contribute to a major portion of the concentrator cost. This makes grinding a crucial process to be considered for optimization and control. There are numerous process variables that are monitored and controlled during a grinding operation. The variables in a grinding circuit are highly inter-related and the intricate interaction among them makes the process difficult to understand from an operational viewpoint.
Modeling and simulation of grinding circuits have been used by past researchers for circuit design and pre-flowsheet optimization in terms of processing capacity, recovery rate, and product size distribution. However, these models were solved under steady approximation and did not provide any information on the system in real time. Hence, they cannot be used for real time optimization and control purposes. Therefore, this research focuses on developing a dynamic simulator for a grinding circuit. The Matlab/Simulink environment was used to program the models of the process units that were interlinked to produce the flowsheet of a grinding circuit of a local gold mine operating in Alaska. The flowsheet was simulated under different operating conditions to understand the behavior of the circuit. The explanation for such changes has also been discussed.
The dynamic simulator was then used in designing a neural network based controller for the semi-autogenous mill (SAG). A two-layer non-linear autoregressive (NARX) neural network with feed to the mill as exogenous input was designed using data generated by the simulator for a range of operating conditions. Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) and Bayesian Regularization (BR) training algorithms were used to train the network. Comparison of both algorithms showed LM performed better provided the number of parameters in the network were chosen in a prudent manner. Finally, the implementation of the controller for maintaining SAG mill power to a reference point is discussed.},

This paper presents details of an Arduino micro-controller temperature control lab as a benchmark for modeling and control methods. As opposed to simulation studies, a physical benchmark considers real process characteristics such as the requirement to meet a cycle time, discrete sampling intervals, communication overhead with the process, and model mismatch. An example case study of the benchmark is quantifying an optimization approach for a PID controller with 5.4\% improved performance. A multivariate example shows the quantified performance improvement by using model predictive control with a physics-based model, an autoregressive time series model, and a Hammerstein model with an artificial neural network to capture the static nonlinearity. These results demonstrate the potential of a hardware benchmark for transient modeling and regulatory or advanced control methods.},

	abstract = {Comminution, particularly milling, is on average the largest consumer of energy in mining. Actual comminution circuits consist in most of the cases in coarse crushing, SAG milling, pebble crushing and secondary ball milling. In these circuits the SAG mill is the largest energy consumer. In many engineering projects either a power equation and/or a specific energy equation are used for the designing of these mills but not always with acceptable results. In general these equations are used to predict power consumption as a function of mill size, level and density of the internal charge and \% of critical speed. Almost none of these equations (with the notable exception of the Morrell{\textquoteright}s model) consider explicitly the effect that the feed particle size has on the mill performance, particularly on the power and on the specific energy consumption of the mill. To address this fact new models are developed in this work able to predict power or specific energy consumption, including the usual design variables, but adding a variable that represents the feed size distribution. Operational data from 4 grinding circuits corresponding to 3 Chilean copper concentration plants are used and the \% {\`A}600 +100 ({\`A}152 +25 mm) is selected as independent variable. The results indicate that both models are able to estimate the required variables for all data sets. In the first model (power equation) the average error obtained was 3.7\% and in the second model (specific energy) the average error was 6.8\%. These models would be useful for performance optimisation of the test case mills and should be fitted (parameters values) again for other mills.},

	abstract = {A comminution model is developed for ball mills using the principles of perfect mixing. T-lines are developed from data arising from single particle breakage tests using a laser monitored, twin pendulum breakage device. A t1.4parameter is developed that produces afamily t-lines which can be mode!ed using linear equations. This eliminates the current problem of using splines to model tcurves as is the case with the tJO parameter. A linear relationship is also found between the natural logs of the t-number and the slopes of the t-lines making calculation of breakage progeny fractions much easier. A simpler exponential relationship between the comminution energy Ecs and the tl.4 parameter is developed which eliminates the need for constants. A lower triangular appearance matrix H is derived from these t-lines using data from an existing survey carried out on he Cu Concentrator circuit at Mt 1sa Mines, Mt [sa, Australia. The mode! uses a top-down method of calculating the elements in the matrix and each hu element in the matrix is the tl.4parameter relating to a particular feed size fraction. The comminution energy Ecs can then be scaled to account for various changes in mill operating conditions particularly feed tonnage. @ 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, the current trends in the process system engineering tasks of modeling, design, and optimization in multiphase systems, are analyzed. Different scales of size and time are included, and therefore, the analysis includes modeling at the molecular level (molecular dynamic modeling) and unit operation level (e.g., computational fluid dynamic, CFD), and the application of optimization for the design of a plant. New strategies for the modeling, design, and optimization of multiphase systems are also included, with a strong focus on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and the combination of experimentation and modeling with response surface methodology (RSM). The integration of different modeling techniques such as CFD with discrete element simulation (DEM) and response surface methodology (RSM) with artificial neural networks (ANN) is included. The paper finishes with tools to study the uncertainty, both epistemic and stochastic, based on uncertainty and global sensitivity analyses, which is present in all mineral processing operations. It is shown that all of these areas are very active and can help in the understanding, operation, design, and optimization of mineral processing that involves multiphase systems. Future needs, such as meso-scale modeling, are highlighted.},

The advantages and disadvantages of each of these approaches are discussed with examples. By way of review, the authors begin with the geostatistical indicator simulation method, based on the truncated{\textendash}Gaussian algorithm; this is followed by multiple-point statistical simulation and then the stochastic geometry approach, which is based on marked point process simulation. A new approach, based on pluriGaussian structural simulation, is then introduced. The new approach incorporates in the simulation the spatial correlation between different sets of fractures, which in general, is very difficult, if not impossible, to accomplish in the three methods reviewed. Each simulation method is summarised together with detailed simulation procedures for each. A published two-dimensional fracture dataset is used as a means of assessing the performance of each simulation method and of demonstrating the concepts discussed in the text.},

	abstract = {This article proposes a generic plant-wide control framework that can be used to develop a hierarchical control structure (regulatory control, supervisory control, and optimization) to operate a single-stage closed grinding mill circuit in an economically optimal manner. An economic objective function is defined for the grinding mill circuit with reference to the economic objective of the larger mineral processing plant. A mineral processing plant in this study consists of a comminution and a separation circuit and excludes the extractive metallurgy at a metal refinery. The operational performance of a comminution circuit as represented by a single-stage grinding mill circuit, primarily depends on the performance of the grinding mill. Since grind curves define the operational performance range of a mill, grind curves are used to define the set points for the economic controlled variables for optimal steady-state operation. For a given metal price, processing cost, and transportation cost, the proposed structure can be used to define the optimal operating region of a grinding mill circuit for the best economic return of the mineral processing plant. Once the optimal operating condition is defined, the supervisory control aims to maintain the primary controlled variables at the optimal set points. A regulatory control layer ensures the stability of the plant in the presence of disturbances.},

Citic SMCC Process Technology Pty Ltd has developed such a model and in this paper its structure is described. Examples are given of both AG/SAG and ball mills of how the model responds to changes in slurry level. These examples are used to explain the observed phenomena of slurry pooling and the decrease in power draw observed in ball mills after start-up when feed is first introduced into the mill.},

Many advanced control schemes, including model predictive control (MPC), adaptive control, neuro-control, robust control, optimal control, etc., have been reported in the field of grinding process. However, these control schemes including the MPC scheme usually cannot achieve satisfying effects in the presence of strong disturbances. In this paper, disturbance observer (DOB), which is widely used in motion control applications, is introduced to estimate the disturbances in grinding circuit. A compound control scheme, consisting of a feedforward compensation part based on DOB and a feedback regulation part based on MPC (DOB{\textendash}MPC), is thus developed. A rigorous analysis of disturbance rejection performance is given with the considerations of both model mismatches and external disturbances. Simulation results demonstrate that when controlling the ball mill grinding circuit, the DOB{\textendash}MPC method possesses a better performance in disturbance rejection than that of the MPC method.},

Generally, precise estimates imply detailed plant models that could be difficult to build and update in practice. The trade-off between modeling efforts and estimation performances has thus lead to various approaches to deal with plant dynamics. The objective of the paper is to review and compare most common observers used for dynamic data reconciliation in the mineral and metallurgical processing industries. Comparisons are carried out using a separation unit and a flotation circuit as simulated benchmark plants. Observer performances are evaluated in terms of variance reduction. Strengths and weaknesses of the different methods are highlighted. Aspects such as estimation of model parameters, detection of gross errors, and handling of bilinear equations and plant non-linearities are discussed.},

The control schemes in previous literatures, including detuned multiloop PID control, model predictive control (MPC), robust control, adaptive control, and so on, demonstrate limited abilities in control ball mill grinding process in the presence of strong disturbances. The reason is that they do not handle the disturbances directly by controller design. To this end, a disturbance observer based multi-variable control (DOMC) scheme is developed to control a two-input-two-output ball mill grinding circuit. The systems considered here are with lumped disturbances which include external disturbances, such as the variations of ore hardness and feed particle size, and internal disturbances, such as model mismatches and coupling effects. The proposed control scheme consists of two compound controllers, one for the loop of product particle size and the other for the loop of circulating load. Each controller includes a PI feedback part and a feed-forward compensation part for the disturbances by using a disturbance observer (DOB). A rigorous analysis is also given to show the reason why the DOB can effectively suppress the disturbances. Performance of the proposed scheme is compared with those of the MPC and multi-loop PI schemes in the cases of model mismatches and strong external disturbances, respectively. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method has a better disturbance rejection property than those of the MPC and PI methods in controlling ball mill grinding circuits.},

The grind curves indicate the operable region of the grinding mill. An analysis and dynamic simulation of the model show that the model captures the main dynamics of the grinding mill. Further simulations demonstrate that the model represents the full range of steady-state conditions defined by the grind curves. In other words, the dynamic model is quantitatively accurate as it settles at the correct steady-state for the operable region of the grinding mill. Therefore, the model is suitable as a simulator to test and develop optimizing control strategies for global operating conditions rather than only for local operating conditions.},

	abstract = {Stable control of the ball mill grinding process is very important to reduce energy losses, enhance operation efficiency, and recover valuable minerals. In this work, a controller for the ball mill grinding process is designed using a combination of model predictive control (MPC) with the equivalent-input-disturbance (EID) approach. MPC has been researched and applied widely as one of the multi-variable control algorithms for grinding. It is used to decouple in real time. The controller design does not deal with the disturbances directly. However, strong disturbances such as those caused by ore hardness and feed particle size exist in the ball mill grinding. EID estimates the equivalent disturbance of the grinding circuit in the control input channel and integrates this disturbance directly into the control law in order to suppress disturbances promptly and effectively. This results in good disturbance suppression performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the combination of MPC with EID for controlling the ball mill grinding circuit yields better performance in terms of disturbance rejection, rapid response, and strong robustness as compared to the performance of the MPC and proportional-integral (PI) decoupling control.},

These modes provide an integrated response to changes in feed mineralogy, and other operational conditions within the mineral value chain. The decision to alternate between modes depends on current and forecasted stockpile levels. Moreover, the optimization of stockpile thresholds that would trigger a mode change is related to the classical RQ problem from inventory theory. Particularly for concentrators that are designed for blended feeds, there may be production intervals in which a particular ore class is at risk of stockout. Indeed, geological uncertainty causes stockout risk, which should be balanced with other key performance indicators, including throughput and recovery, and is a context for multiobjective optimization. Computations are presented in which a concentrator that had originally been designed for a certain ore blend, after years of successful operation, now requires alternate modes to realign its operations with geological forecasts.},

	abstract = {The product size distribution resulting from comminution is usually described using a population balance model (PBM) that employs a selection (rate of breakage) function and a breakage (appearance) function to describe how fast each particle size class breaks and the resulting daughter particle size distribution, as described by many authors. The term in parenthesis is the corresponding terminology used by the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre (JKMRC) and in JKSimMet. It has long been known to JKSimMet users that, for a ball mill, the breakage function does not need to be modified for different cases. Adjusting the selection function will suffice to fit the data. This paper details that this is possible because the solution to the grinding equation is not unique. This led to the search of a breakage function/selection function pair that may be a more natural solution to the grinding equation compared to other possible solutions. Such a pair was found and is described herein. Examples of its application to ball milling, cone crushing, and roll crushing (Metso{\textquoteright}s HRC{\texttrademark} high pressure grinding rolls [HPGR]) are presented.},

	abstract = {Most modern population balance models for comminution invoke the concept of a specific breakage rate function and a breakage distribution function to describe breakage kinetics. One of the difficulties of this approach is that these functions are very difficult to measure directly. Consequently, it is usual to assume that these functions can be represented by simple equations with parameters that can easily be estimated from test data using back-calculation techniques. However, these estimates can be very sensitive to small measurement errors and are usually subject to very large variances. This paper presents a simplified approach to modelling comminution processes that invoke the concept of an energy-based cumulative breakage rate function to describe breakage kinetics. This function can be estimated directly from plant data and is well-suited to multi-component modelling of individual rock types and mineral species. Examples of the application of this simplified modelling approach are described for the treatment of platinum ores using ball mills, AG/SAG mills, HPGR{\textquoteright}s and stirred media mills.},

The direct effect of process control on energy efficiency is manyfold: Reducing output variability allows for operating chemical plants closer to their limits, where the energy/economic optima typically lie. Further, good control enables novel, transient operating strategies, such as conversion smoothing and demand response. Indirectly, control systems are key to the implementation and operation of more energy-efficient plant designs, as dictated by the process integration and intensification paradigms.

This paper attempts to characterize mill contents by solving Whiten{\textquoteright}s first-order content-based model in the MATLAB/ Simulink environment. The parameters in the model, such as breakage rate constant, discharge rate and appearance function, were estimated using process and design data collected from a gold mine operating in Alaska coupled with a nonlinear parameter estimation scheme. This model was then used to predict the dynamic responses of other key operational variables, such as mill power, bearing pressure, charge level and product size distribution. The transient response of mill behavior with respect to changes in feed size distribution, tonnage and mill feed water is also presented. This dynamic simulation approach can be used for practicing different control strategy and training purposes. The observed response of mentioned variables was validated using dynamic response data from the plant to encompass operational characteristics of SAG mill behavior.},

Hence accurate mill filling measurements are needed for modelling mills.

This paper discusses a range of available methods for measuring and calculating mill filling and introduces a new technique for accurately measuring filling that eliminates the need to enter the mill in most cases. The new method offers engineers and researchers a safer and faster method for quantifying the filling level in industrial SAG and ball mills, and allows the surface profile to be surveyed, without requiring the contents to be level. The paper also details formulas for calculating the filling level and load volume, which unlike previously published equations, also consider the volume in the conical ends and the volume occupied by the mill shell lifters.},

	abstract = {Industrial processes often show typical nonstationarity, resulting from frequent variation of working condition. It is rather challenging to assess the operating performance of nonstationary processes, since the process property is time-variant and the standard of performance levels may differ from working conditions. Besides the nonstationarity, nonlinearity widely exists in industrial processes, making it hard to analyze process characteristics. To solve the above problems, a three-dimensional (3-D) online modeling and assessment method of operating performance is proposed in the present work. Considering that the inner drive of nonstationarity is often the fluctuation of working condition, 3-D space is established, including sample, variable, and working condition axes. Thus, the process can be modeled and assessed online along direction of the working condition indicator to handle both nonstationarity and nonlinearity. Within the 3-D space, the selection of online training data and establishment of assessing model are solved simultaneously through multi-objective optimization, to make the training data suitable for performance assessment and preserve high assessment accuracy. Bayesian inference based criterion is then defined to determine the performance level. Finally, the validation on a three-phase flow facility and a coal mill of a power plant show feasibility and superiority of the proposed method on performance assessment for nonstationary industrial processes with nonlinearity.},

The methodology integrates both a global search routine to avoid cost function local minima, and a Jack-knife resampling and recalibration technique to estimate the parameter confidence. The simulator will serve in future work for the coupling of separation processes, and thus the development of plant-wide model-based optimisation and control strategies.},

	abstract = {The successful application of modelling and simulation in design and optimisation rests heavily on having a model which is lifelike. In the case of Autogenous (AG) and Semi-autogenous (SAG) mills this has provided a significant challenge to modellers, due in part to the interaction between feed characteristics and mill performance and also due to the difficulty in obtaining high quality relevant data from full-scale circuits. As a result the literature contains numerous papers on AG/SAG mill modelling, the majority of which contain little or no data to indicate how well the models predict full-scale mill performance. In an attempt to address this problem a new AG/SAG mill model has been developed which incorporates the capability to respond to changes in most design and operational variables. The model can be used as a stand-alone design tool, to scale-up from pilot data and to optimise existing circuits. It predicts throughput, power draw and product size distribution as well as load size distributions and slurry hold-up. The overall structure of the model and the sub-processes that it contains is described. The model is successfully validated using data from over 21 different full-scale circuits.},

These plants are major energy consumers and therefore energy efficiency is becoming an important objective. Other incentives are the energy cost that will probably continue to rise and the environmental and social pressures for reducing energy consumption. Using more energy efficient equipment is a first approach. Better plant operation using on-line data processing, as described in this paper, is another way to improve energy efficiency. On-line data processing consists in using the measurements provided by sensors and the knowledge of the plant behaviour to automatically, continuously and adequately manipulate plant actuators. An ideal on-line data processing is made up of three hierarchic layers: process observation, process control and process optimization. The layers, their interaction and their energetic benefits are described. Some case studies illustrate the energy efficiency improvements provided to mineral processing plants by using on-line data processing techniques.},

Prior to the controller installation, it was necessary to solve various problems related to the process, such as a cyclic behaviour of the rod millfeedtonnage, a problem related to the mill water source and the calibration of the flowmeters. Once these problems were solved, the control strategy was accomplished in two steps. Step 1 corresponds to the installation of control loops to regulate the pump box level and the cyclone overflow density. Step 2 describes the implementation of a loop to control the cyclone feed density. According to Part I, a loop to control the circulating load is also part of the original design.

By simulation on DYNAFRAG, it was possible to discriminate among several control structures.

	abstract = {In the mining industry, decisions regarding the type and number of comminution tests to be completed typically rely on geologists{\quotedblbase} observations and conclusions when studying drill cores. Given that these decisions are based on visual observations, they are essentially approximate and often inaccurate from a comminution viewpoint, causing a sizeable margin of error in estimating characterization test needs. Consequently, companies are often forced to perform more tests than necessary, requiring a significant quantity of material, and accruing significant costs. Recently, a new device, called the Hardness Index Tester (or HIT), was developed, offering users a low cost in-house mechanism for estimating the comminution parameter A*b and the Bond Ball Mill Work Index at any mine site, with potential applications on fragments up to 25 mm from drill core. In late 2016, Agnico Eagle Mines Limited initiated a trial to investigate if having an HIT device installed in a core repository would make it possible to identify the different rock properties more accurately and determine the number and type of comminution tests required. The application of the HIT was not to replace the standard comminution tests, but rather to generate a high number of comminution and geomechanical parameters for the rock mass. Ultimately, the objective would be to determine the uniformity of the rock mass and, therefore, easily distinguish any potentially problematic zones. With this method, the appropriate number of standard tests could be determined, making the HIT not only an excellent complement to the standard laboratory tests, but also an indispensable device for a geometallurgical characterization. This paper presents the results from the HIT trial using samples from the Odyssey Project, which is a Mine Canadian Malartic property.},

Version III builds on two earlier versions by incorporating energy distributions derived from discrete element modelling, an updated version of the 4D breakage appearance function which applies to a broader size range, and addresses multi-component ore breakage via the probability distribution of energy split based on material stiffness. The model has been tested against multi-component plant survey data. GTMMS III suggests a mechanistic insight into mixture prediction through component analysis and is a step forward towards the unified comminution model (UCM) with its mechanistic, generic, and dynamic prediction capability.},

	abstract = {The fraction of mill volume occupied by rocks, grinding media and slurry in grinding mills are dominant factors influencing AG and SAG mill power draw and grinding rate. Hence accurate mill filling measurements are needed for modelling mills. To that end, it is usually necessary to enter the confined space of a grinding mill, a task that involves a degree of safety risk and a potentially lengthy plant stoppage. This paper discusses a range of available methods for measuring and calculating mill filling and introduces a new technique for accurately measuring filling that eliminates the need to enter the mill in most cases. The new method offers engineers and researchers a safer and faster method for quantifying the filling level in industrial SAG and ball mills, and allows the surface profile to be surveyed, without requiring the contents to be level. The paper also details formulas for calculating the filling level and load volume, which unlike previously published equations, also consider the volume in the conical ends and the volume occupied by the mill shell lifters.},

	abstract = {In November 2017, Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (AEM) initiated a program to evaluate the value of routine ore hardness testing using semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) feed samples in forecasting the SAG Mill/Ball Mill (SAB) grinding circuit performance. Daily samples were collected over a two-month period and submitted for Hardness Index Tester (HIT) evaluation to provide estimates of the competency (Axb) and grindability (Bond ball mill work index [BMWi]). The statistical analysis of the ore hardness and WipFrag online sizing data suggest a strong correlation that confirmed the well-known expectation that feed size and hardness do affect the grinding performance, even in a secondary crushed feed situation. This means introducing routine HIT testing at site will enable the operations to maximize the throughput for a set grind target and verify if the grinding circuit is performing optimally for the actual feed, rather than feed predicted from mine planning and scheduling.},

	title = {{HIT} {\textendash} a {Portable} {Field} {Device} for {Rapid} {Testing} at {Site}},
	abstract = {The index A*b, determined from the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre (JKMRC) drop weight tester (DWT) results, has become well-known in the mining industry as a reliable measure of ore hardness in impact or crushing, having the inferred units of t/kWh. This index evolved from a long history of comminution studies at the JKMRC, including the development of the now superseded JKTech twin-pendulum, the industry standard JK Drop Weight Tester (JKDWT) and the faster alterative JKMRC rotary breakage tester (JKRBT). A reduced version of the DWT, the semi-autogenous grinding mill comminution test (SMC test{\textregistered}), also provides estimates of the A*b though the testing of only one particle size at five specific energies. Experimental determination of A*b using the above devices/tests requires samples, with sufficient mass, to be sent to designated laboratories, registered to conduct such tests. This protocol is fine for bankable and commercial testing, where material characterisation data is used in conjunction with machine specific data in modelling and simulation, and power based calculations. However, for comparative testing, where results are required at the time of sampling (eg for plant troubleshooting or spot-surveys), or for rapid ranking of geometallurgical samples, these existing tests simply do not provide a timely, viable and cost-effective solution. In order to address this critical void in the realm of comparative testing, a new device has been developed, exploiting a central feature of single particle impact testing {\textendash} that the A*b can be reliably estimated using one precise low energy test. This device, for which a patent is currently pending, called the HIT (Hardness Index Tester), has been precision engineered to allow users to break narrowly sized fragments at a set specific energy, in a safe and easy manner. The manufacturing materials have been chosen carefully to ensure compatibility with the intended use and portability to any site, whilst minimising cost. The device is supplied with a novel quality assurance / quality control (QA/QC) feature, to ensure that the targeted potential energy is consistently delivered. The product from the HIT breakage test can be quickly sized using a single screen to determine the mass per cent undersize, from which the A*b index is calculated directly at site {\textendash} eliminating the need to send the raw data off-site for analysis. On presized fragments, a single test using 20 fragments takes less than five minutes to complete, and the results are immediately available. The HIT is currently being tested at a major mining laboratory in the US and the results to date have proved it can deliver on all fronts. This paper describes the new prototype device, which offers users a low cost in-house mechanism for estimating the A*b at any mine site, with potential applications on fragments up to 25 mm from drill core, blast chip rejects or the grinding circuit feed. It also outlines the results of field tests carried out by an objective third party mining group and compares the results with those from current industry standard tests conducted on the same material.},

An ARMAX model structure is determined using the stepwise regression method. Starting with a list of the presumably correlated candidate variables, the method selects, one by one and in a systematic manner, the variables that best model the measurement to be replaced. Not only the single measurements are included in the list of candidates, but also combinations of such measurements having physical significance. A phenomenological model has been built with the purpose of determining these combinations. It turns out that, in most of the cases, the components of combined measurements were selected by the method, instead of the single measurements. Actual grinding plant data is used to determine the model structure, to estimate the model parameters and to test the predictive capability of the soft-sensors developed.

	url = {https://corpus.ulaval.ca/jspui/handle/20.500.11794/67317},
	abstract = {As minerals frequently appear in complex associations in nature, mineral liberation is one of the most relevant aspects in ore processing and is achieved through comminution. This operation is one of the most important, but also one of the most expensive ones in industry. The global efficiency of a plant often depends on the performance of the grinding circuit, since there is a compromise to achieve the particle size liberating the targetted minerals in order to obtain high purity concentrates while maintaining low operating costs, which are largely influenced by the energy consumption. In recent years, companies have been facing more demanding performance targets, stronger competition, and more stringent environmental and safety regulations. Additional challenges are inherent to the grinding circuits themselves, e.g. the nonlinear responses, high degree of intercorrelation of the different variables, and material recirculations. The abovementioned issues highlight the relevance of adequate process control and optimisation, and practitioners rely more often on model-based approaches in order to face them systematically. Modeling and simulation are powerful tools with significant advantages such as low costs, required times for conducting experiments are relatively short, and the possibility of testing extreme operational conditions as well as different circuit configurations without disrupting production. Evidently, the quality of the results will only be as good as the model capacity to represent the reality, which emphasises the relevance of having precise models and proper calibration procedures, the latter being a topic frequently omitted in the literature. Another crucial aspect that has not been reported yet is the effective integration of mineral liberation in control and optimisation schemes. Although it is a key piece of information directly related to the performance of the concentration stage, most strategies focus exclusively on the particle size. This is understandable given that it is currently impossible to measure the liberation distribution online. Based on an existing mineral processing plant simulation library, this research addresses these problems by (1) developing a mineral liberation model aiming at linking the grinding and concentration stages; (2) programming a phenomenological autogenous/semiautogenous (AG/SAG) mill model, required to complement the simulation toolbox, and validating it through calibration; (3) coupling a grinding circuit simulator to a concentration process by means of the liberation model, and (4) developing a plantwide control and optimisation scheme considering mineral liberation data explicitly to evaluate the economic benefits. The main results confirm that the liberation model is capable of reproducing accurately mineral distributions observed in industry. If calibration data correspond to a single operating point, its validity may however be limited to the close neighbourhood. Characterising the evolution of mineral liberation in different operating conditions and transient states remains to be addressed. The liberation model proved to be equally useful in coupling grinding circuits with concentration processes, specifically for flotation. As for the AG/SAG mill model, it can capture the steady state and dynamic behaviour of an actual device and, along with the rest of pieces of equipment in the simulation toolbox, of industrial grinding circuits. This was confirmed through calibration from plant data and laboratory testwork following a systematic procedure, contributing to the endeavour of establishing standard calibration methodologies. Lastly, the results of the designed control and optimisation scheme suggest that using liberation data for control and real-time optimisation can improve the overall performance of grinding-separation circuits by reacting to variations in the liberation characteristics, which in turn influence the concentration performance. The case study reveals that doing so can lead to increases in the concentrate mass flow rate and grade, metal recovery, and global profits in the order of +0.5\%, +1\%, +1\%, and +5\%, respectively, compared to the case omitting this information.},

	abstract = {High-pressure grinding rolls crushers (HPGR) are typically operated at constant pressure with variable rolls speed maintaining choke-fed conditions. Since this simple approach works well in practice, there has been little incentive to further study their control, and the literature on this topic is scarce. Economic model predictive control (EMPC) of mineral processing circuits faces a similar situation, because its benefits are yet to be quantified. This paper presents case studies of different process control strategies on a simulated mineral processing plant comprising an HPGR crusher, ball mill, and flotation circuit. The simulator is based on population balance modelling and is an extension of previous work. Operating costs and grinding product characteristics are linked to flotation performances to allow estimating the profits. They are used as a metric to compare advanced regulatory control to plant-wide EMPC in scenarios where identical sequences of disturbances are simulated on the feed ore particle size and hardness. The results show that in normal operating conditions, the EMPC performance is equivalent to a standard advanced regulatory scheme, but it surpasses it when plant feed rate is limited.},

It is well known that the feed size distribution (FSD) has a significant impact on the performance of a mill. Image processing on the feed material has made it possible to monitor this data in an on-line manner. Several applications have been reported in literature where the FSD was used as a disturbance variable in an advanced controller. Little has been done however, to determine the contribution of the FSD to the performance of the controller.
In order to quantify the benefit of this disturbance variable the controller will be run in a state where the variable alternates between being enabled and disabled. Controller performance will also be assessed by an LQG benchmark that incorporates the effect of a measured disturbance.},

	abstract = {Fluctuations in feed size distribution are second only to ore competence variation in their influence on autogenous and semi-autogenous mill performance. For some operations where feed size is not well controlled this creates significant problems with mill stability and is understandably seen as a major problem area. Some operations, however, have recognized an opportunity in the relationship between feed size and mill performance and manipulate feed size to obtain efficiency improvements. Examples include changes to blasting practices, ROM stockpiling, partial or fully secondary crushing and selective prescreening of sag mill feed. This paper presents and analyses a variety of plant data which illustrates the influence of feed size distribution variation on mill performance and discusses the reasons why ag and sag mills respond the way they do. From this analysis recommendations for optimum feed size distributions are made.},
